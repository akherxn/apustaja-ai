Your Giddy Face Beamed In The Tenderly Framed Photograph Set Beside Your Coffin. I Dared Not Look At Your Real Face In That Moment We Pretended To Not Hear You Breathing And Continued. At The Very Least, You Could Have Stopped The Priest.
Value your physical forme while you still have it. Do not push your luck.
weird how turkey day seems to bring that out in our kind but you know us we'd never eat our own
In this lonely mirage, you two would build your home.
It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.
In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.
i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying
i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.
It’s okay to be Italian, but maybe not all the time.

me? oh yeah. i know all about stones.
A beating heart. A sentient brain ruled by self-determination. A short-lived creation meant to live only as long as the universe sees fit. A beautiful creature that fights for its life at every step, breathing as much air as possible, breathing as much oxygen as possible.
I wish I was a scribe in ancient Mesopotamia!!!  I was born in the wrong generation :(
Value your physical forme while you still have it. Do not push your luck.
I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.
Despite our biological elements, we might be made of love ourselves! By just existing, there is love in this world. Isn't that beautiful? I've decided lovemail is no longer needed. Because... we were the lovemail all along. And so, this is the final lovemail.
That never happened. It wouldn't ever happen. I prayed that it might. I wanted her to be free from the cycle of puzzle assembly.

Rejection is always hard to cope with. Regardless of people involved, the pain of holding one-sided feelings for somebody can be debilitating.  What can you do in this scenario? There are many ways you can deal with being rejected. For example... When I get rejected, I...  I...

maybe ill start shaking less now that youre not around me all the time, not because im conquering my fear or im jumping over mental hurdles... but.... because ive given up? i just know that ill never find someone like you again, so... really... i dont have anyone left to impress.
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.
I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.
The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.
I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.
I wish the punishment kennel was still a thing.
I wish I was a scribe in ancient Mesopotamia!!!  I was born in the wrong generation :(
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.
Look at the clothes I’m wearing. They’re exquisitely normal, wouldn’t you agree? There’s nothing colourful or bright going on. I’m not wearing any iron-on patches to let the world know what I think, and I’m not parading around a graphic-tee either, and neither are you.
Do full-time mods even DO anything else???

Mingled in with the intermittent sputterings of your overworked computer vent, you can hear soft sobs from deep within your workstation PC.
God didn’t want me to hold the people I love
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.
Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?
... ive been thinking recently. you know, about us. i miss us. i really miss us. i know that what we once were will never see the light of day again, and i know everything we fought for is, evidently, over, but.... I don't know.
Aren't there supposed to be decomposition stains?
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
But what else goes into love mail? Not a shred of humanity. Nor is any human emotion required to make love mail.

My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.

You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
i always shake so much when no ones around, and even more when someone is around... and even more when youre around, i guess. not that youre around anymore, i mean.

No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.

Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.
Look at the clothes I’m wearing. They’re exquisitely normal, wouldn’t you agree? There’s nothing colourful or bright going on. I’m not wearing any iron-on patches to let the world know what I think, and I’m not parading around a graphic-tee either, and neither are you.
Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!
I, Nagito Komaeda, do not wish to be kept alive through artificial means. Please let me go, since I am already gone. Please, remove the tube.

Ummm. I'd like to tell you something. The nurse told me to think of a happy memory before surgery, and I thought of you. I'm sure you could have guessed that though. I just really wanted to tell you about it. Have you had any surgery recently? Did you think of me too?

i used to dream of rolling out of bed and making you breakfast, you know? i would have made your poached eggs on toast the way your mother taught me how, only warming the bread up in the oven instead of burning it to a crisp. &gt; Freak. &gt; That sounds hard to deal with.

You and I… Perhaps we’d fit comfortably in that sort of world. We’d slide right into our numbered places, with our pod beds and our electric organs.

Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!
But what else goes into love mail? Not a shred of humanity. Nor is any human emotion required to make love mail.

Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
me? oh yeah. i know all about stones.
Rejection is always hard to cope with. Regardless of people involved, the pain of holding one-sided feelings for somebody can be debilitating.  What can you do in this scenario? There are many ways you can deal with being rejected. For example... When I get rejected, I...  I...

In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.
No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.
It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'

FEATHERED SMILING WRETCH, I WON'T LET IT SENSE OR NEAR; I FEEL UNHOLINESS, THE MURKING DARK
Komaeda will never be tainted by the filthy hands of capitalism.
i used to dream of rolling out of bed and making you breakfast, you know? i would have made your poached eggs on toast the way your mother taught me how, only warming the bread up in the oven instead of burning it to a crisp. &gt; Freak. &gt; That sounds hard to deal with.
It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
In this lonely mirage, you two would build your home.
It’s okay to be Italian, but maybe not all the time.
I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
Look at the clothes I’m wearing. They’re exquisitely normal, wouldn’t you agree? There’s nothing colourful or bright going on. I’m not wearing any iron-on patches to let the world know what I think, and I’m not parading around a graphic-tee either, and neither are you.
This picture of me was taken when I was in heaven. It was fun. I was bathed in a golden light the whole time. They gave me this suit to wear, but I had to give it back the same day.
I’m afraid of what people will think of me. I know they see it in my eyes - if not that I’m already rotted, they’ll see that I KNOW I’m rotted, and they’ll learn that horrible truth from my all-too-telling expression.
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.

But what else goes into love mail? Not a shred of humanity. Nor is any human emotion required to make love mail.
No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.

In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.

My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
Ummm. I'd like to tell you something. The nurse told me to think of a happy memory before surgery, and I thought of you. I'm sure you could have guessed that though. I just really wanted to tell you about it. Have you had any surgery recently? Did you think of me too?

You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'

Despite our biological elements, we might be made of love ourselves! By just existing, there is love in this world. Isn't that beautiful? I've decided lovemail is no longer needed. Because... we were the lovemail all along. And so, this is the final lovemail.
I want an ending where komaeda curls up in a ball on the floor eating bread and the scene ends like this.

Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?

Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.
I'd rather not look at the sky. I think I'll remain looking at the ground. I'm safer when I'm closer to the Earth's core.

Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.
I’m rotting from the inside out. My organs are overflowing with filth and bile!  This world will only flourish once it’s been cleansed of me completely!!! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me!

Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!
Oft I weep myself to slumber. I exist alone, you see. I wish for somebody to reach inside my chest and pull my rib, as though he be God, and I Adam, and craft another soul to fare this lonesome Garden of Eden. Combined with clay, we build anew. Darling, I am in love with you

No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.
The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
But what else goes into love mail? Not a shred of humanity. Nor is any human emotion required to make love mail.

I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.
ill walk straight into work and ill put my hat on, pin my nametag to my shirt, and silently pray to god that one of the million faces that walk through the front door is yours.
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
I’m rotting from the inside out. My organs are overflowing with filth and bile!  This world will only flourish once it’s been cleansed of me completely!!! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me!
Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.
Despite our biological elements, we might be made of love ourselves! By just existing, there is love in this world. Isn't that beautiful? I've decided lovemail is no longer needed. Because... we were the lovemail all along. And so, this is the final lovemail.

Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.

I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?

No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.
i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.

I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.
May He Rest In Peace. ...He's Not Dead, But He May As Well Be. Fuck Him.
I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.
Rejection is always hard to cope with. Regardless of people involved, the pain of holding one-sided feelings for somebody can be debilitating.  What can you do in this scenario? There are many ways you can deal with being rejected. For example... When I get rejected, I...  I...
It’s okay to be Italian, but maybe not all the time.

In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.
Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.

I, Nagito Komaeda, do not wish to be kept alive through artificial means. Please let me go, since I am already gone. Please, remove the tube.

Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!

You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.

i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.

I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.

Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
ill walk straight into work and ill put my hat on, pin my nametag to my shirt, and silently pray to god that one of the million faces that walk through the front door is yours.
I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.
No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
As if the last tear that dropped from your eye were fossilized into a pearl, I cherished the oyster that closed forever. Affixed to mine arm as if it were a tetanned jaw. That door forever closed, I see it in my dreams. You, too. So it was meant to be.

Komaeda will never be tainted by the filthy hands of capitalism.
Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.
This picture of me was taken when I was in heaven. It was fun. I was bathed in a golden light the whole time. They gave me this suit to wear, but I had to give it back the same day.
In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

I can only do so much to talk them through it, though... I'm busy with my own stuff. And I'm not even a full-time mod. Me and Gromaeda... we don't go back like, say, Mod 43 and Gromaeda, or Mod 33 and Gromaeda. I don't know how much me talking about it helps.

May He Rest In Peace. ...He's Not Dead, But He May As Well Be. Fuck Him.
Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?
I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.
Do full-time mods even DO anything else???

God didn’t want me to hold the people I love
Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.

I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.
MOON BURNED INTO MY SKIN I COULD FEEL IT DANGLING, MEMBRANE, SOFT, ORGANS FED IT OUT
maybe ill start shaking less now that youre not around me all the time, not because im conquering my fear or im jumping over mental hurdles... but.... because ive given up? i just know that ill never find someone like you again, so... really... i dont have anyone left to impress.

Look at the clothes I’m wearing. They’re exquisitely normal, wouldn’t you agree? There’s nothing colourful or bright going on. I’m not wearing any iron-on patches to let the world know what I think, and I’m not parading around a graphic-tee either, and neither are you.

It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?
What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.

Rejection is always hard to cope with. Regardless of people involved, the pain of holding one-sided feelings for somebody can be debilitating.  What can you do in this scenario? There are many ways you can deal with being rejected. For example... When I get rejected, I...  I...
i used to dream of rolling out of bed and making you breakfast, you know? i would have made your poached eggs on toast the way your mother taught me how, only warming the bread up in the oven instead of burning it to a crisp. &gt; Freak. &gt; That sounds hard to deal with.

I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.

He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!

I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.
Komaeda will never be tainted by the filthy hands of capitalism.
In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.
You and I… Perhaps we’d fit comfortably in that sort of world. We’d slide right into our numbered places, with our pod beds and our electric organs.

I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.

Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.
This picture of me was taken when I was in heaven. It was fun. I was bathed in a golden light the whole time. They gave me this suit to wear, but I had to give it back the same day.
What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.
That never happened. It wouldn't ever happen. I prayed that it might. I wanted her to be free from the cycle of puzzle assembly.
You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'
i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying
No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.

I'd rather not look at the sky. I think I'll remain looking at the ground. I'm safer when I'm closer to the Earth's core.
I can only do so much to talk them through it, though... I'm busy with my own stuff. And I'm not even a full-time mod. Me and Gromaeda... we don't go back like, say, Mod 43 and Gromaeda, or Mod 33 and Gromaeda. I don't know how much me talking about it helps.

i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.

Despite our biological elements, we might be made of love ourselves! By just existing, there is love in this world. Isn't that beautiful? I've decided lovemail is no longer needed. Because... we were the lovemail all along. And so, this is the final lovemail.
My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?
I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.

Ummm. I'd like to tell you something. The nurse told me to think of a happy memory before surgery, and I thought of you. I'm sure you could have guessed that though. I just really wanted to tell you about it. Have you had any surgery recently? Did you think of me too?

Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!

What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.
i always shake so much when no ones around, and even more when someone is around... and even more when youre around, i guess. not that youre around anymore, i mean.
I don’t want to be a clown anymore!
The very next day, she went out to the Hobby Lobby and bought a replacement, which she efficiently re-assembled and hung in the exact same spot, with a new frame and glass to keep it safe. The puzzles never stopped.
I wish the punishment kennel was still a thing.
Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
i used to dream of rolling out of bed and making you breakfast, you know? i would have made your poached eggs on toast the way your mother taught me how, only warming the bread up in the oven instead of burning it to a crisp. &gt; Freak. &gt; That sounds hard to deal with.
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.
That never happened. It wouldn't ever happen. I prayed that it might. I wanted her to be free from the cycle of puzzle assembly.
In this lonely mirage, you two would build your home.
Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.
Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!
I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.

You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
Rejection is always hard to cope with. Regardless of people involved, the pain of holding one-sided feelings for somebody can be debilitating.  What can you do in this scenario? There are many ways you can deal with being rejected. For example... When I get rejected, I...  I...

Do you think... Do you think that... I could become hu—
The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.
I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.
i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.
I wish the punishment kennel was still a thing.
Do full-time mods even DO anything else???
You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'
This picture of me was taken when I was in heaven. It was fun. I was bathed in a golden light the whole time. They gave me this suit to wear, but I had to give it back the same day.
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.

i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying

In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

I wish I was a scribe in ancient Mesopotamia!!!  I was born in the wrong generation :(
I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.

it’s okay if He doesn’t love you.
God didn’t want me to hold the people I love
But what else goes into love mail? Not a shred of humanity. Nor is any human emotion required to make love mail.
The very next day, she went out to the Hobby Lobby and bought a replacement, which she efficiently re-assembled and hung in the exact same spot, with a new frame and glass to keep it safe. The puzzles never stopped.
I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.

As if the last tear that dropped from your eye were fossilized into a pearl, I cherished the oyster that closed forever. Affixed to mine arm as if it were a tetanned jaw. That door forever closed, I see it in my dreams. You, too. So it was meant to be.
My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.

Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.

No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.

FEATHERED SMILING WRETCH, I WON'T LET IT SENSE OR NEAR; I FEEL UNHOLINESS, THE MURKING DARK
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?
Ummm. I'd like to tell you something. The nurse told me to think of a happy memory before surgery, and I thought of you. I'm sure you could have guessed that though. I just really wanted to tell you about it. Have you had any surgery recently? Did you think of me too?
MOON BURNED INTO MY SKIN I COULD FEEL IT DANGLING, MEMBRANE, SOFT, ORGANS FED IT OUT
It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
ITS NOT HIS FAULT HIS MEMORY WAS WIPED HE ONLY YEARNS AGAIN TO BE FULLY HUMAN

Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
You and I… Perhaps we’d fit comfortably in that sort of world. We’d slide right into our numbered places, with our pod beds and our electric organs.
Value your physical forme while you still have it. Do not push your luck.
i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.
I’m afraid of what people will think of me. I know they see it in my eyes - if not that I’m already rotted, they’ll see that I KNOW I’m rotted, and they’ll learn that horrible truth from my all-too-telling expression.
ill walk straight into work and ill put my hat on, pin my nametag to my shirt, and silently pray to god that one of the million faces that walk through the front door is yours.
Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.
I don’t want to be a clown anymore!
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.

The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.
I wish the punishment kennel was still a thing.
As if the last tear that dropped from your eye were fossilized into a pearl, I cherished the oyster that closed forever. Affixed to mine arm as if it were a tetanned jaw. That door forever closed, I see it in my dreams. You, too. So it was meant to be.
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.
In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.
Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
Oft I weep myself to slumber. I exist alone, you see. I wish for somebody to reach inside my chest and pull my rib, as though he be God, and I Adam, and craft another soul to fare this lonesome Garden of Eden. Combined with clay, we build anew. Darling, I am in love with you
maybe ill start shaking less now that youre not around me all the time, not because im conquering my fear or im jumping over mental hurdles... but.... because ive given up? i just know that ill never find someone like you again, so... really... i dont have anyone left to impress.

Komaeda will never be tainted by the filthy hands of capitalism.
I'd rather not look at the sky. I think I'll remain looking at the ground. I'm safer when I'm closer to the Earth's core.
I’m rotting from the inside out. My organs are overflowing with filth and bile!  This world will only flourish once it’s been cleansed of me completely!!! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me!
But what else goes into love mail? Not a shred of humanity. Nor is any human emotion required to make love mail.

You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'

Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.

I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.

What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.

You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?
I’m rotting from the inside out. My organs are overflowing with filth and bile!  This world will only flourish once it’s been cleansed of me completely!!! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me!
Oft I weep myself to slumber. I exist alone, you see. I wish for somebody to reach inside my chest and pull my rib, as though he be God, and I Adam, and craft another soul to fare this lonesome Garden of Eden. Combined with clay, we build anew. Darling, I am in love with you
Despite our biological elements, we might be made of love ourselves! By just existing, there is love in this world. Isn't that beautiful? I've decided lovemail is no longer needed. Because... we were the lovemail all along. And so, this is the final lovemail.

What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.

In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.
i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?

... ive been thinking recently. you know, about us. i miss us. i really miss us. i know that what we once were will never see the light of day again, and i know everything we fought for is, evidently, over, but.... I don't know.
Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.
Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.
i always shake so much when no ones around, and even more when someone is around... and even more when youre around, i guess. not that youre around anymore, i mean.
WHIG? SNATCHED ON THE 22ND OF JULY, 1845
Much To Our Chagrin, As If Possessed By An Otherworldly Force, You Stood Up From Your Coffin. Right In The Middle Of A Touching Cello Solo, You Walked From The Funeral Hall. A Most Disgraceful Show. The Tickets Did Not Sell Out For You To Ruin This For Us. You Know Who You Are.

The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.
Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!

What's out there? Is it you...? I'm so cold. I'm so cold.  Where I am now, there are no more lights.  Last night I dreamt I was holding your hand.
As if the last tear that dropped from your eye were fossilized into a pearl, I cherished the oyster that closed forever. Affixed to mine arm as if it were a tetanned jaw. That door forever closed, I see it in my dreams. You, too. So it was meant to be.
You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'

i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying
I can only do so much to talk them through it, though... I'm busy with my own stuff. And I'm not even a full-time mod. Me and Gromaeda... we don't go back like, say, Mod 43 and Gromaeda, or Mod 33 and Gromaeda. I don't know how much me talking about it helps.
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.

Despite our biological elements, we might be made of love ourselves! By just existing, there is love in this world. Isn't that beautiful? I've decided lovemail is no longer needed. Because... we were the lovemail all along. And so, this is the final lovemail.
I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.
Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.
Rejection is always hard to cope with. Regardless of people involved, the pain of holding one-sided feelings for somebody can be debilitating.  What can you do in this scenario? There are many ways you can deal with being rejected. For example... When I get rejected, I...  I...

I’m rotting from the inside out. My organs are overflowing with filth and bile!  This world will only flourish once it’s been cleansed of me completely!!! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me!

No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.

You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
Look at the clothes I’m wearing. They’re exquisitely normal, wouldn’t you agree? There’s nothing colourful or bright going on. I’m not wearing any iron-on patches to let the world know what I think, and I’m not parading around a graphic-tee either, and neither are you.

Looking up at a skyscraper, you cannot fathom how tall it is. That's another disconcerting thing about them. Even looking all the way at the top, your mind parses it as a 2-dimensional object, as if you're looking at a paper cutout of a perspective shot of that mammoth building.
I’m afraid of what people will think of me. I know they see it in my eyes - if not that I’m already rotted, they’ll see that I KNOW I’m rotted, and they’ll learn that horrible truth from my all-too-telling expression.

Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!

You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'

i used to dream of rolling out of bed and making you breakfast, you know? i would have made your poached eggs on toast the way your mother taught me how, only warming the bread up in the oven instead of burning it to a crisp. &gt; Freak. &gt; That sounds hard to deal with.

In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?
I wish I was a scribe in ancient Mesopotamia!!!  I was born in the wrong generation :(
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.
Oft I weep myself to slumber. I exist alone, you see. I wish for somebody to reach inside my chest and pull my rib, as though he be God, and I Adam, and craft another soul to fare this lonesome Garden of Eden. Combined with clay, we build anew. Darling, I am in love with you

He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
I’m afraid of what people will think of me. I know they see it in my eyes - if not that I’m already rotted, they’ll see that I KNOW I’m rotted, and they’ll learn that horrible truth from my all-too-telling expression.
It’s okay to be Italian, but maybe not all the time.
You and I… Perhaps we’d fit comfortably in that sort of world. We’d slide right into our numbered places, with our pod beds and our electric organs.
... ive been thinking recently. you know, about us. i miss us. i really miss us. i know that what we once were will never see the light of day again, and i know everything we fought for is, evidently, over, but.... I don't know.
i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying
Ummm. I'd like to tell you something. The nurse told me to think of a happy memory before surgery, and I thought of you. I'm sure you could have guessed that though. I just really wanted to tell you about it. Have you had any surgery recently? Did you think of me too?
I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.
maybe ill start shaking less now that youre not around me all the time, not because im conquering my fear or im jumping over mental hurdles... but.... because ive given up? i just know that ill never find someone like you again, so... really... i dont have anyone left to impress.

I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.
i always shake so much when no ones around, and even more when someone is around... and even more when youre around, i guess. not that youre around anymore, i mean.
weird how turkey day seems to bring that out in our kind but you know us we'd never eat our own
As if the last tear that dropped from your eye were fossilized into a pearl, I cherished the oyster that closed forever. Affixed to mine arm as if it were a tetanned jaw. That door forever closed, I see it in my dreams. You, too. So it was meant to be.
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.

In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
God didn’t want me to hold the people I love
Looking up at a skyscraper, you cannot fathom how tall it is. That's another disconcerting thing about them. Even looking all the way at the top, your mind parses it as a 2-dimensional object, as if you're looking at a paper cutout of a perspective shot of that mammoth building.

Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!

I can only do so much to talk them through it, though... I'm busy with my own stuff. And I'm not even a full-time mod. Me and Gromaeda... we don't go back like, say, Mod 43 and Gromaeda, or Mod 33 and Gromaeda. I don't know how much me talking about it helps.

If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.
i used to dream of rolling out of bed and making you breakfast, you know? i would have made your poached eggs on toast the way your mother taught me how, only warming the bread up in the oven instead of burning it to a crisp. &gt; Freak. &gt; That sounds hard to deal with.
In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.

weird how turkey day seems to bring that out in our kind but you know us we'd never eat our own
maybe ill start shaking less now that youre not around me all the time, not because im conquering my fear or im jumping over mental hurdles... but.... because ive given up? i just know that ill never find someone like you again, so... really... i dont have anyone left to impress.
I'd rather not look at the sky. I think I'll remain looking at the ground. I'm safer when I'm closer to the Earth's core.
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?
I learned to accept my humanity. Now, I can love.
Despite our biological elements, we might be made of love ourselves! By just existing, there is love in this world. Isn't that beautiful? I've decided lovemail is no longer needed. Because... we were the lovemail all along. And so, this is the final lovemail.

Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
Seven Komaedeuses, there are…
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
I’m rotting from the inside out. My organs are overflowing with filth and bile!  This world will only flourish once it’s been cleansed of me completely!!! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me!
The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.

I miss when we shared one beautiful horrific body. You and me and the sand, open blue skys and open blue sand. Pockets filled with shells and dirt. As the teeth washed ashore, we shoved them in our coat pocket. Our shared pocket, you and I, in unison.

Looking up at a skyscraper, you cannot fathom how tall it is. That's another disconcerting thing about them. Even looking all the way at the top, your mind parses it as a 2-dimensional object, as if you're looking at a paper cutout of a perspective shot of that mammoth building.

Ummm. I'd like to tell you something. The nurse told me to think of a happy memory before surgery, and I thought of you. I'm sure you could have guessed that though. I just really wanted to tell you about it. Have you had any surgery recently? Did you think of me too?
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.
FEATHERED SMILING WRETCH, I WON'T LET IT SENSE OR NEAR; I FEEL UNHOLINESS, THE MURKING DARK
Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.
Komaeda will never be tainted by the filthy hands of capitalism.
That never happened. It wouldn't ever happen. I prayed that it might. I wanted her to be free from the cycle of puzzle assembly.
Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.
You and I… Perhaps we’d fit comfortably in that sort of world. We’d slide right into our numbered places, with our pod beds and our electric organs.
Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?
Rejection is always hard to cope with. Regardless of people involved, the pain of holding one-sided feelings for somebody can be debilitating.  What can you do in this scenario? There are many ways you can deal with being rejected. For example... When I get rejected, I...  I...
You've never loved and you've never lost. You've never had surgery, or shared a positive thought towards anyone. You're a scam, you know that? A complete and utter scam. I should have never trusted you with my love mail.
I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.
maybe ill start shaking less now that youre not around me all the time, not because im conquering my fear or im jumping over mental hurdles... but.... because ive given up? i just know that ill never find someone like you again, so... really... i dont have anyone left to impress.

My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.
I wish the punishment kennel was still a thing.
Do full-time mods even DO anything else???
i always shake so much when no ones around, and even more when someone is around... and even more when youre around, i guess. not that youre around anymore, i mean.

He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.

Love mail doesn't have to be right or wrong or even true or even useful in the slightest sense to any whose eyes fall upon it. It is love mail simply by existing. And so... this is love mail. And you are its recipient.
You and I… Perhaps we’d fit comfortably in that sort of world. We’d slide right into our numbered places, with our pod beds and our electric organs.
Mingled in with the intermittent sputterings of your overworked computer vent, you can hear soft sobs from deep within your workstation PC.
Aren't there supposed to be decomposition stains?
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.
Look at the clothes I’m wearing. They’re exquisitely normal, wouldn’t you agree? There’s nothing colourful or bright going on. I’m not wearing any iron-on patches to let the world know what I think, and I’m not parading around a graphic-tee either, and neither are you.
... ive been thinking recently. you know, about us. i miss us. i really miss us. i know that what we once were will never see the light of day again, and i know everything we fought for is, evidently, over, but.... I don't know.
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying
It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
May He Rest In Peace. ...He's Not Dead, But He May As Well Be. Fuck Him.
I felt like I was face to face with a wild animal. It was stuck there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe I was the headlights. Maybe I should just back off and let it run back into the wilderness and be grateful I didn't crash into it.
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?

You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'
The very next day, she went out to the Hobby Lobby and bought a replacement, which she efficiently re-assembled and hung in the exact same spot, with a new frame and glass to keep it safe. The puzzles never stopped.

No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.

I can only do so much to talk them through it, though... I'm busy with my own stuff. And I'm not even a full-time mod. Me and Gromaeda... we don't go back like, say, Mod 43 and Gromaeda, or Mod 33 and Gromaeda. I don't know how much me talking about it helps.
Yes. Yes, that had to be it — not a dream nor a fantasy, but the future! You must crawl towards him; you must reach out to his delicate hand and hold it tight, and he would drag you closer to the water. He would save you! Only if you held onto hope, then he would surely come!

My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.
In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.
In this lonely mirage, you two would build your home.
i really miss us. i wish we could go back to 2014 where everything was smooth, back to 2013 where the biggest problem i could think of was how id be able to talk to you without choking up, back to 2012 when we first met and 2011 when my friend told me about you.
Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?
I left this room a long time ago. When I was still here, sometimes other mods would come in and sleep on that bed when they were scared, so I learnt to always keep it clean, just in case. ...But I live alone now.
maybe ill start shaking less now that youre not around me all the time, not because im conquering my fear or im jumping over mental hurdles... but.... because ive given up? i just know that ill never find someone like you again, so... really... i dont have anyone left to impress.
Have you ever wondered if what you were doing was right.
As if the last tear that dropped from your eye were fossilized into a pearl, I cherished the oyster that closed forever. Affixed to mine arm as if it were a tetanned jaw. That door forever closed, I see it in my dreams. You, too. So it was meant to be.
i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying
it wasn’t enough for someone to love you?
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
All Komaedas Go to Heaven, Except the Bad Ones Who Are Sent to Ancient Mesopotamia
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
Oft I weep myself to slumber. I exist alone, you see. I wish for somebody to reach inside my chest and pull my rib, as though he be God, and I Adam, and craft another soul to fare this lonesome Garden of Eden. Combined with clay, we build anew. Darling, I am in love with you
You and I… Perhaps we’d fit comfortably in that sort of world. We’d slide right into our numbered places, with our pod beds and our electric organs.
You think for a short moment, before remembering. You’re supposed to be relaxing him. It’s what you’re being paid for. 'I… suppose so, sure.' 'You’ve done so much for me, and I’ll be thinking about it in a week from now, and maybe even a month, but will I remember it in a year?'
I'd rather not look at the sky. I think I'll remain looking at the ground. I'm safer when I'm closer to the Earth's core.
I’m rotting from the inside out. My organs are overflowing with filth and bile!  This world will only flourish once it’s been cleansed of me completely!!! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me! Love me!
If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
... ive been thinking recently. you know, about us. i miss us. i really miss us. i know that what we once were will never see the light of day again, and i know everything we fought for is, evidently, over, but.... I don't know.
ITS NOT HIS FAULT HIS MEMORY WAS WIPED HE ONLY YEARNS AGAIN TO BE FULLY HUMAN
Do full-time mods even DO anything else???
Well, it's not like I care that much. I just want to hold somebody. I'm scared of being held myself, though. I don't think I could trust anybody with my internal organs like that.
This picture of me was taken when I was in heaven. It was fun. I was bathed in a golden light the whole time. They gave me this suit to wear, but I had to give it back the same day.
I wish I was a scribe in ancient Mesopotamia!!!  I was born in the wrong generation :(
I don’t want to be a clown anymore!
weird how turkey day seems to bring that out in our kind but you know us we'd never eat our own
Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.
WHIG? SNATCHED ON THE 22ND OF JULY, 1845
i used to dream of rolling out of bed and making you breakfast, you know? i would have made your poached eggs on toast the way your mother taught me how, only warming the bread up in the oven instead of burning it to a crisp. &gt; Freak. &gt; That sounds hard to deal with.
That never happened. It wouldn't ever happen. I prayed that it might. I wanted her to be free from the cycle of puzzle assembly.
The me you knew is not the me I am. It’s sad, isn’t it? The person you met has become something entirely different over the course of just a couple short years.
i thought about a lot of things when i was in surgery. i thought about arctic winds blowing down from the north and i thought about melting ice caps and rising sea lines. i thought about each and every message in a bottle that no one finds, and i woke up after surgery crying
FEATHERED SMILING WRETCH, I WON'T LET IT SENSE OR NEAR; I FEEL UNHOLINESS, THE MURKING DARK
In this sullen place, you're really doing it a favor by putting it out of its misery.  Destroying it feels nice for a moment.  ...  Oh... That was the last thing out here. Perhaps the only living thing, as far as you can see.  But at least it's gone now.

it’s okay if He doesn’t love you.
... ive been thinking recently. you know, about us. i miss us. i really miss us. i know that what we once were will never see the light of day again, and i know everything we fought for is, evidently, over, but.... I don't know.
Ummm. I'd like to tell you something. The nurse told me to think of a happy memory before surgery, and I thought of you. I'm sure you could have guessed that though. I just really wanted to tell you about it. Have you had any surgery recently? Did you think of me too?
ill walk straight into work and ill put my hat on, pin my nametag to my shirt, and silently pray to god that one of the million faces that walk through the front door is yours.
The words came out of your mouth faster than you could process it. He might be a bit eccentric, but he's been kind to you. Maybe he's growing on you? ...Like, in a romantic way, not in a mold or parasite kind of way. Although you bet he would think the latter options are great.
The very next day, she went out to the Hobby Lobby and bought a replacement, which she efficiently re-assembled and hung in the exact same spot, with a new frame and glass to keep it safe. The puzzles never stopped.
HOPE REMAINS IN HUMANITY AND NO OTHER
Do you know what went into this final lovemail? Love, mail, effort, time, blood, sweat, tears, and hope. Hope for a new future. A better one. One where we can fix the mistakes we made and grow. I grew.

Look at the clothes I’m wearing. They’re exquisitely normal, wouldn’t you agree? There’s nothing colourful or bright going on. I’m not wearing any iron-on patches to let the world know what I think, and I’m not parading around a graphic-tee either, and neither are you.
God didn’t want me to hold the people I love
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
I wish the punishment kennel was still a thing.
ITS NOT HIS FAULT HIS MEMORY WAS WIPED HE ONLY YEARNS AGAIN TO BE FULLY HUMAN
No emotion is more powerful than love. And it comes in many different ways. It  could be a 'hello' from a friend, or a 'good-bye' from an enemy. It's 'see you soon' and 'welcome back' simultaneously, it's music recommendations and homework help. It comes in all shapes and sizes.
Sometimes, I think we forget the positive effects of physical contact. We, on our computers, locked behind closed doors, forget what it's like to embrace somebody. It doesn't matter if they're your friend or not. It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not.
Aren't there supposed to be decomposition stains?
Your Giddy Face Beamed In The Tenderly Framed Photograph Set Beside Your Coffin. I Dared Not Look At Your Real Face In That Moment We Pretended To Not Hear You Breathing And Continued. At The Very Least, You Could Have Stopped The Priest.

If you grew up where there was no silence as we know it, and, instead, this silence was a little… mumbling from the machines, would you notice it? Would that become your new silence?
I'd like to, though. I want to feel somebody's hands on my cold body. I want somebody to hold me. I want somebody to hold my heart, raw and flesh, in their hands and look at it, shaking as they do. I imagine it would be quite scary.
Would you mind… if I was at your side? If I sank my skin into yours?

A beating heart. A sentient brain ruled by self-determination. A short-lived creation meant to live only as long as the universe sees fit. A beautiful creature that fights for its life at every step, breathing as much air as possible, breathing as much oxygen as possible.
My hands are wrapped around my waist in a faux display of intimacy. It’s a constant reminder to keep those I need most close to me at all times.
It's all fake. I know that, for a fact, everything on this blog is fake. Everything you're saying to me now is fake.
God didn’t want me to hold the people I love
May He Rest In Peace. ...He's Not Dead, But He May As Well Be. Fuck Him.
He won’t look me in the eyes anymore. When I reach out to take his hand, he pushes me away. I wish it could be the same as it was before.
I imagined my wrists broken just enough to keep the feeling from crawling up my arm.
It's a road movie, a double-feature, two boys striking out across America, while desire, like a monster, crawls up out of the lake
Something’s not right about what I’m doing but I’m still doing it– living in the worst parts, ruining myself.
Let’s say you’re driving down the road with your eyes closed but my eyes are also closed. You’re by the side of the road.
He puts his hands all over you to keep you in the room. It’s night. It’s noon. He’s driving. It’s happening all over again.
I ran and I knew you wouldn’t catch me. You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.
he isn’t looking at a bird, real bird, as he paints, he is looking at his heart, which is impossible.
Let me tell you a story about war.
You wonder what he’s thinking when he shivers like that. What can you tell me, what could you possibly tell me?
We have not been given all the words necessary. We have not been given anything at all. We’ve been driving all night. We’ve been driving a long time. We want to stop. We can’t.
Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating.
You could drown in those eyes, I said.
Black cherries in chocolate, the ring around the moon, a beetle underneath a glass—you cannot make out all the words, but you're sure he knows you're in there, and he's singing to you, even though you don't know who he is.
There’s a thing in my stomach about this. A simple thing. The last rung.
And then the sense of being smothered underneath a sack of lentils or potatoes, or of a boat at night slamming into the dock again without navigation, without consideration,
Left hand raising the fork to the mouth, feeling the meat slide down your throat, thinking My throat. Mine. Everything in this cone of light is mine.
When I die, I will come in fast and low.
What would you like? I’d like my money’s worth. Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this— swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
I watched TV. I had a Coke at the bar. I had four dreams in a row where you were burned, about to burn, or still on fire.
He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand.
It is waiting, like a broken door, like the red dog that chases its tail and eats your rosebushes and then must be forgiven.
We tremble and I paint the trembling.
So now we have come to a great battlefield, the warmth of the fire, the fire still burning, the heat escaping like a broken promise.
Suppose for a moment we are crowded around a pier, waiting for something to ripple the water. We believe in you. There is no danger. It is not getting dark, we want to say.
Take a body, maybe your own, and dump it gently. All your dead, unfinished selves and dump them gently.
But you are my nomad and I love you sideways daily.
Bird 1: This is the wrong story. Bird 2: All stories are the wrong story if you are impatient.
We all move forward anyway. Ripples in all directions. What is a ghost? Something dead that seems to be alive.
They look like me. I move them around. I prefer to blame others, it’s easier. King me.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder. One thing. Come closer. Listen...
he isn’t looking at a bird, real bird, as he paints, he is looking at his heart, which is impossible.
Let’s say you’re still completely in the dark but we love you anyway. We love you. We really do.
You said I could have anything I wanted, but I just couldn’t say it out loud. Actually, you said Love, for you, is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’s terrifying. No one will ever want to sleep with you.
I’m battling monsters, I’m pulling you out of the burning buildings and you say I’ll give you anything but you never come through.
This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
It's a puzzle: each piece, each room, each time you put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, your ear to the wound that whispers.
the roar of the freeway, the roar of the city sheening across the city. There should be a place.
You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together  to make a creature that will do what I say or love me back.
I cut off my head and threw it on the ground. I walked away. This is how we measure, walking away.
The radio aches a little tune that tells the story of what the night is thinking. It’s thinking of love.
Was there no one else? Left-handed truth, right-handed truth, there’s no pure way to say it.
A man walks into a convenience store, still you, saying: I only wanted something simple, something generic...
We carve up the world and crown it with numbers—lumens, ounces, decibels.
Let's say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men.
he is trying to kill you, and you deserve it, you do, and you know this, and you are ready to die in this swimming pool
I was away, I don't know where, lying on the floor, pretending I was dead. I wanted to hurt you but the victory is that I could not stomach it.
Let's say God in his High Heaven is hungry and has decided to make himself some tuna fish sandwiches. He's already finished making two of them, on sourdough, before he realizes that the fish is bad.
Everyone needs a place. You need it for the moment you need it, then you bless it— and move on. Who does this? No one.
This boy, half-destroyed, screaming Drive into that tree, drive off the embankment.
and you realize the one person in the world who loves you isn’t the one you thought it would be,
A stone on the path means the tea’s not ready, a stone in the hand means somebody’s angry, the stone inside you still hasn’t hit bottom.
Sorry about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.
but tell me you love this, tell me you’re not miserable.
This is good advice. He couldn’t do it. There is no way to get to the future from here.
We’ve made a graveyard out of the bone white afternoon.
But angels are pouring out of the farmland, angels are swarming over the grassland, Angels rising from their little dens, arms swinging, wings aflutter, dropping their white-hot bombs of love.
You cannot get in the way of anyone's path to God.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you.
His hands keep turning into birds, and his hands keep flying away from him.
The fact of his pulse, the way he pulled his body in, out of shyness or shame or a desire not to disturb the air around him.
Like sandpaper, the light, or a blessing, or a bruise. Blood everywhere, he said, the red light hemorrhaging from everywhere at once.
he is trying to kill you, and you deserve it, you do, and you know this, and you are ready to die in this swimming pool
Let me tell you a story about war.
Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this— swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
Phone's for you, Jeff says. Hey! It's Uncle Jeff, who isn't really your uncle, but you can't talk right now, one of the Jeffs has put his tongue in your mouth. Please let it be the right one.
Take it or leave it, and for the most part you take it. Not just the idea of it but the ramifications of it.
I passed through the narrow gate, stumbled in, stumbled around for a while, and stumbled back out. I made this place for you. A place for you to love me.
So, you kiss him, and he doesn’t move, he doesn’t pull away, and you keep on kissing him.
Something is not right about what I’m doing but I’m still doing it—living in the worst parts, ruining myself.
We’re filming the movie called Planet of Love- there’s sex of course, and ballroom dancing, fancy clothes and waterlilies in the pond,
You take her out into the rain and you fall in love with her and she leaves you and you’re desolate.
It reminds me of some tale, stay with me to remember, it reminds me of where I was going without you.
If there was one thing I could save from the fire, he said, the broken arms of the sycamore, the eucalyptus still trying to climb out of the yard —
but tell me you love this, tell me you’re not miserable.
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party.  Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party
You wanted to think of yourself as someone who did these kinds of things. You wanted to be in love and he happened to get in the way.
suddenly darkness,  suddenly only darkness.
In these dreams it’s always you: the boy in the sweatshirt, the boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me from jumping off the bridge.
he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist,
If you don’t believe in God, then who are you talking to?
He is looking at the wall and I am looking at his looking. Difficult thing, to be scrutinized so long.
I’m a romantic, an absurdist. I am bad with facts and I get confused. I’m a hostile witness. I didn’t want to see this, talk about this. I wanted to testify to something else.
Your math is crazy, says the moon.
The radio aches a little tune that tells the story of what the night is thinking. It’s thinking of love. It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him—
Hello darling, sorry about that. Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud. Especially that, but I should have known.
we laugh and it pits the world against us, we laugh, and we’ve got nothing left to lose, and our hearts turn red, and the river rises like a barn on fire.
Inside your head you hear a phone ringing  and when you open your eyes  only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.
I'm the director and I'm screaming at you, I'm waving my arms in the sky, and everyone's watching, everyone's curious, everyone's holding their breath.
Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
Makes a cathedral, him pressing against me, his lips at my neck, and yes, I do believe his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me like stars.
I couldn’t get a death certificate. These things are complicated, says the Health Department. Their names remain on the deed to the house. It isn’t haunted, it’s owned by ghosts.
Two brothers: one of them wants to take you apart. Two brothers: one of them wants to put you back together.
but more frequently I was finding myself sleepless, and he was running out of lullabies.
World-wise, world-weary, and not his mother's favorite, this Jeff will always win when it all comes down tofisticuffs. Unfortunately for him, it doesn't always all come down to fisticuffs.
Someone is digging your grave right now.
I borrowed your shoes and didn’t put them away. You were crying and eating rice.
I swallow your heart and you make me spit it up again. I swallow your heart and it crawls right out of my mouth.
And angels, about twelve angels, angels knocking on your head right now, hello hello, a flash in the sky, would you like to meet him there, in Heaven?
When she saw herself, finished, she said, It doesn’t look like me. Picasso said, It will.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which Jeff you are.
there’s a niche in his chest  where a heart would fit perfectly, and he thinks if he could just maneuver one into place– well then, game over.
A man says to another man, Can I tell you something? The other man says, No.
And he wouldn’t kiss me, but he covered my body with his body and held me down until I promised not to run back out into the street again.
The water is flat, flat and calm, it seems a sheet of glass. You look at it, the more you look at it the more you feel like you are looking into your own head
Everyone needs a place. It shouldn’t be inside of someone else. I kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.
A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says: Walk a mile in my shoes.
There’s smashed glass glittering everywhere like stars.
He wants to be tender and merciful. That sounds overly valorous. Sounds like penance. And his hands? His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him. Him being you.
Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.  You still get to be the hero.
Wanted for murder, a price on his head, Caravaggio does what he always does—he tries to paint his way out of it.
They all have perfect teeth: white, square, clean, even. And, for some reason, the lighting in the room makes their teeth seem closer than they should be, as if each mouth was a place, a living room with pink carpet and the windows open.
and you realize the one person in the world who loves you isn’t the one you thought it would be,
Dear Forgiveness, you know that recently  we have had our difficulties and there are many things I want to ask you.
I couldn’t make you love me and I’m tired of pulling your teeth.
Trees outside the window and a big band sound that makes you feel like everything's okay, a feeling that lasts for one song maybe, the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.
We pull our boots on with both hands but we can’t punch ourselves awake and all I can do is stand on the curb and say Sorry about the blood in your mouth.
The hand sings weapon. The mind says tool. The body swerves in the service of the mind, which is evidence of the mind but not actual proof.
Sure, I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow  glass, but that comes later.
When he throws the wrench into the air it will catch the light as it spins toward you. Look—it looks like a star.
Leave a trail of letters like those little knots of bread we used to dream about. We used to dream about them. We used to do a lot of things.
Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too…
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart?
Unless his heart is a metaphor for his heart, as everything is a metaphor for itself, so that looking at the paint is like looking at a bird that isn’t there, with a song in its throat that you don’t want to hear but you paint anyway.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which twin you are in love with at the time.
I’m battling monsters, I’m pulling you out of the burning buildings and you say I’ll give you anything but you never come through.
I told you so. Yes, you did, dear.
Draw a circle with a piece of chalk. Imagine standing in a constant cone of light. Imagine surrender. Imagine being useless.
Man, moon, ghost, zero--naming rounds off.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
When we were little we made houses out of cardboard boxes. We can do anything. It's not because our hearts are large, they're not, it's what we struggle with.
Forget the dragon,  leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.
The enormity of my desire disgusts me.
His hands keep turning into birds, and his hands keep flying away from him.
If there was one thing I could save from the fire, he said, the broken arms of the sycamore, the eucalyptus still trying to climb out of the yard —
Wanted for murder, a price on his head, Caravaggio does what he always does—he tries to paint his way out of it.
It’s love or it isn’t. It isn’t over.
I surrender my desire to be healed. The blurriness of being alive.
… the hunter’s heart, the hunter’s mouth, the trees and the trees and the space between the trees, swimming in gold.
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and you're trying not to tell him that you love him, and you're trying to choke down the feeling, and you're trembling,
I wanted to be thrown over, possessed.
Here is the hallway and here are the doors and here is the fear of the other thing, the relentless thing, your body drowning in gravity.
Tell me we’re dead and I’ll love you even more. I’m surprised that I say it with feeling.
Look, Jeff, I'm telling you, for the last time, I mean it, etcetera. They are the same and they are not the same. They are the same and they hate each other for it.
Consider the hairpin turn. It is waiting for you like a red door or the broken leg of a dog.
Jeff or Jeff? Who do you want to be? You just wanted to play in your own backyard, but you don't know where your own yard is, exactly.
suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness.
he is trying to kill you, and you deserve it, you do, and you know this, and you are ready to die in this swimming pool
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven,
They're hurling their bodies down the freeway to the smell of gasoline, which is the sound of a voice saying I told you so.
I passed through the narrow gate, stumbled in, stumbled around for a while, and stumbled back out. I made this place for you. A place for you to love me.
It makes me tired, Henry. Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I’m getting at?
We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
Here is the list with all of your names, Jeff. They're not the same name, Jeff. They're not the same at all.
the light on his skin and bouncing off his skin.
Sometimes, at night, in bed, before I fall asleep, I think about a poem I might write, someday, about my heart, says the heart.
I try to guess your trajectory and end up telling my own story.  We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
If you were walking away, keep walking.
He’s on top of you. He’s next to you, right next to you in fact. He has the softest skin wrapped entirely around him. It isn't him
The enormity of my desire disgusts me.
Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake and dress them in warm clothes again.
Chemical names, bird names, names of fire and flight and snow, baby names, paint names, delicate names like bones in the body, Rumplestiltskin names that are always changing, names that no one’s ever able to figure out.
Let’s admit, without apology, what we do to each other. We know who our enemies are. We know.
And you can hear the man in the apartment above you taking off his shoes. You hear the first boot hit the floor and you’re looking up, you’re waiting
I don’t really blame you for being dead but you can’t have your sweater back. So, I said, now that we have our dead, what are we going to do with them?
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart? and you said Kiss me.
I will turn myself into a gun, because it’s all I have, because I’m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own.
All of us are trapped in our skins and drowning in gravity. Physics is unforgiving. Nature is predatory. We do not walk through a passive landscape.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you've done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you're tired.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven,
I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.
and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces.
He wants to be tender and merciful. That sounds overly valorous. Sounds like penance. And his hands? His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him. Him being you.
I couldn’t make you love me and I’m tired of pulling your teeth.
Disheartening? Obviously. I hope it’s love. I’m trying really hard to make it love. I said no more severity.
And all my fingers turned to twigs. Inside himself he jumped a little.
And the boy who loves you the wrong way keeps weakening.
We are all going forward. None of us are going back.
These, our bodies, possessed by light. Tell me we’ll never get used to it.
Precise. A landmark. You might like it here.  I think that you might like it here.
At home: the moon delivered.
The one on the left has gone bad in the middle, and the other one on the left is about to. As they wrestle, you can tell that they have forgotten about God, and they are very hungry.
Yellow, yellow, gold, and ocher. We stopped. We held the field. We stood very still.
You see them through the backseat window as you and your parents drive past. You are twelve years old. You do not have a brother. You have never experienced anything this ferocious or intentional with another person.
Shame means you’re guilty, like the rest of us, but you think you’re better than we are.
History throws its shadow over the beginning, over the desktop, over the sock drawer with its socks, its hidden letters.
Forget about his insides, his plumbing and his furnaces, put a thing in his hand and be done with it.
The clock ticks from five to six. Kissing degenerates into biting.
We’re shouting the scene where I swallow your heart and you make me spit it up again.
Let me do it right for once,  for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,  you know the story, simply heaven.
Will you defend yourself?  From me, I mean. Let’s kill something.
They looked at the sky, and at the mud, and at their hands in the mud, and their dead friends in the mud. This went on for a long time.
Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too…
You were burned, you were about to burn, you’re still on fire.
You were burned, you were about to burn, you’re still on fire.
Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating.
I was trying to convince you that I was a vampire.
So, I said, now that we have our dead, what are we going to do with them?
His hands keep turning into birds, and his hands keep flying away from him. Eventually the birds must land.
what’s there to be faithful to? I am faithful  to you, darling. I say it to the paint.
He was not dead yet, not exactly— parts of him were dead already, certainly other parts were still only waiting for something to happen, something grand,
Why live a life? Well, why are you asking?
But you are my nomad and I love you sideways daily. Sideways because I have to beam my love in all directions, hoping it bounces off something and eventually finds you.
You were very beautiful.
What is he going to do with these sandwiches? They're already made, but he doesn't want to eat them.
What is he going to do with these sandwiches? They're already made, but he doesn't want to eat them.
Here is my hand, my heart, my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated cities at the center of me, and here is the center of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we can drink from, but I can’t go through with it.
the names of flowers that open only once, shouted from balconies, shouted from rooftops, or muffled by pillows, or whispered in sleep,
You said Tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...
Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this— swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
I mean the buildings that were not the hospital. I shouldn’t have mentioned the hospital.
So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog  of non-definitive acts, something other than the desperation.
It should follow, you know this, like the panels of a comic strip,
A man walks into a bar and says: Take my wife–please. But you take him instead. You take him home, and you make him a cheese sandwich, and you try to get his shoes off, but he kicks you and he keeps kicking you.
You are here. You are here. You're still right here.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which Jeff you are.
The enormity of my desire disgusts me.
Here is a brick with blood on it. (Fact) I am speaking from my heart. (Fact)
And then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view  of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts.
When I die, I will come in fast and low. I will stick the landing. There will be no confusion. The dead will make room for me.
You thought if you handed over your body he’d do something interesting.
I’ll be your slaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue and final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me like the bullet was already there, like it’s been waiting inside me the whole time.
So, I said, now that we have our dead, what are we going to do with them?
Brother, dead brother, who speaks to him in dreams. These are a few things worth saying.
Forget about his insides, his plumbing and his furnaces, put a thing in his hand and be done with it.
The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it.
My father was buried down the road, in a box his other son selected, the ashes of his third wife in a brass urn that he will hold in the crook of his arm forever. At the reception, after his funeral, I got mean on four cups of Lime Sherbet Punch.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here,
The attempt to say Come over. Bring your friends. It's a potluck, I'm making pork chops, I'm making those long noodles you love so much.
Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.
Let me tell you a story about war.
This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
A man walks into a bar and says: Take my wife–please. But you take him instead. You take him home, and you make him a cheese sandwich, and you try to get his shoes off, but he kicks you and he keeps kicking you.
Wearing your clothes or standing in the shower for over an hour, pretending that this skin is your skin, these hands your hands, these shins, these soapy flanks.
Take a body, maybe your own, and dump it gently. All your dead, unfinished selves and dump them gently.
In the dream I don’t tell anyone, you put your head in my lap.
Difficult, to be confronted with the fact of yourself. Opaque in the sense of finally solid, in the sense of see me, not through me.
The yard is dark, the tomatoes are next to the whitewashed wall, the book on the table is about Spain, the windows are painted shut.
Names of spells and names of hexes, names cursed quietly under the breath, or called out loudly to fill the yard, calling you inside again, calling you home.
all I can do is stand on the curb and say Sorry about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.
I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark.
There are so many things I’m not allowed to tell you. I touch myself, I dream
The stranger says there are no more couches and he will have to sleep in your bed. You try to warn him, you tell him you will want to get inside him, and ruin him, but he doesn't listen.
Add a second light and you get a second darkness, it’s only fair.
What are you still doing in this field? Get out of the field! You should be in the hotel room! You should, at least, be trying to get back into the hotel room. Ah! Now the field is empty.
A man walks into a bar and says: Take my wife–please. But you take him instead. You take him home, and you make him a cheese sandwich, and you try to get his shoes off, but he kicks you and he keeps kicking you.
your life is over anyway. You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things.
Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too…
When he said this, she would stub out a cigarette, mutter something under her breath. Eventually, he was forced to divorce her. Then, he died. Then she did. The man was not my father.
He doesn’t know what to do with his hands. He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
Then you wanted pasta, so we trampled out into the tomatoes and rolled around to make the sauce.
You could love this boy with all your heart.
the gentleness that comes, not from the absence of violence, but despite the abundance of it.
You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things. You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do long division, and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy,
you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do,
Inside your head you hear a phone ringing  and when you open your eyes  only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.
Something’s not right about what I’m doing but I’m still doing it– living in the worst parts, ruining myself.
And words, little words, words too small for any hope or promise, not really soothing but soothing nonetheless.
I never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way, and I don’t want to be the kind that says the wrong way. But it doesn’t work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats.
He's next to you, right next to you in fact, so close, or...he isn't.
You do the math, you expect the trouble. The seaside town. The electric fence.
or rain, our bodies wet, clothes clinging arm to elbow, clothes clinging nipple to groin — I’ll be right here. I’m waiting.
You miss the point: the face in the mirror is a little traitor, the face in the mirror is a pale and naked hostage and no one can tell which room he’s being held in.
Come closer. We’ll whisper it in your ear.
You see it as a room, a tabernacle, the dark hotel. You're in the hallway again, and you open the door, and if you're ready you'll see it, but maybe one part of your mind decides that the other parts aren't ready,
We all move forward anyway. Ripples in all directions. What is a ghost? Something dead that seems to be alive.
your hands a river gesture,
Build me a city and call it Jerusalem. Build me another and call it  Jerusalem.
Power. The men spread, the thought extends. I paint them out, I paint them in again. A blur of forces.
This is not harmless, the how to touch it, we do not want the screen completely lifted from our eyes, just lifted long enough to see the holes.
We have come back from Jerusalem where we found not  what we sought, so do it over, give me another version,  a different room, another hallway, the kitchen painted over  and over,
suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness.
I say the phrases that keep it all going, and everybody plays along.
You see them through the backseat window as you and your parents drive past. You are twelve years old. You do not have a brother. You have never experienced anything this ferocious or intentional with another person.
Hello darling, sorry about that. Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud. Especially that, but I should have known.
You’re on your back in your undershirt, a broken man on an ugly bedspread, staring at the water stains on the ceiling.
I do believe his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me like stars.
Trees outside the window and a big band sound that makes you feel like everything's okay, a feeling that lasts for one song maybe, the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.
The way it's night for many miles, and then suddenly it's not, it's breakfast and you're standing in the shower for over an hour, holding the bar of soap up to the light.
The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube?
You said, tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon.
The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it. This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
Rely on one thing too long and when it disappears you have nothing--well, that's just bad planning.
The clock ticks from five to six. Kissing degenerates into biting.
I’m bleeding, I’m not just making conversation.
When he throws the wrench into the air it will catch the light as it spins toward you. Look—it looks like a star.
Want something to chase you? Run.
Someone once told me that explaining is an admission of failure. I’m sure you remember, I was on the phone with you, sweetheart.
Bird 1: This is the wrong story. Bird 2: All stories are the wrong story if you are impatient.
the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.
I kissed my mouth, it was no longer a mouth. I threw a spear at my head, I didn’t have a head.
a suit of fur, a coat of mud, a kick in the pants, a lungful of glass, the sails in wind and the slap of waves on the hull
Imagine: Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it. You didn’t think you’d feel this way.
So what’s left? Sing a song about the room we’re in? Hammer in the pegs that fix the meaning to the landscape?
Please keep him safe. Let him lay his head on my chest and we will be like sailors, swimming in the sound of it, dashed to pieces.
My shadow falls across him and it doesn’t go away.
You are playing cards with three Jeffs. One is your father, one is your brother, and the other is your current boyfriend. All of them have seen you naked and heard you talking in your sleep.
There will be no confusion.
I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you.
Every story has its chapter in the desert, the long slide from kingdom to kingdom through the wilderness, where you learn things, where you're left to your own devices.
A dark-haired man in a rented bungalow is licking the whiskey from the back of your wrist. He feels nothing,
Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too…
Our scope was larger than I realized, which only made me that much more responsible.
Some say God is where we put our sorrow. God says, Which one of you fuckers can get to me first?
Desire driving his hands right into your body. Hush, my sweet. These tornados are for you.
These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to clean them up like this.
I wanted to be wanted and he was very beautiful, kissed with his eyes closed, and only felt good while moving.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him— green eyes flecked with yellow, dried leaves on the surface of a pool—
You do this, you do. You take the things you love  and tear them apart or you pin them down with your body and pretend they’re yours.
And he hasn’t moved, he’s frozen, and you’ve kissed him, and he’ll never forgive you, and maybe now he’ll never leave you alone.
The road outside the house lies flat on the ground. The ground surrenders.
Theories: about the nature of the thing. And of the soul. Because people die. The fear: that nothing survives. The greater fear: that something does.
Mirrors and shop windows returned our faces to us, replete with the tight lips and the eyes that remained eyes and not the doorways we had hoped for.
the gentleness that comes, not from the absence of violence, but despite the abundance of it.
The view from above— untethered scrutiny. It helps to have an anchor but your head is going somewhere anyway.
Here is my hand, my heart, my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated cities at the center of me, and here is the center of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we can drink from, but I can’t go through with it.
You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.
While you're deciding, the afternoon light is streaming through the windows behind the bank of checkout counters. Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.
And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile.
And, for a while, I thought I was the princess, cotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle, young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with confidence
Imagine you are in a field of daisies. What are you doing in a field of daisies? Get up!
It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
My shadow falls across him and it doesn’t go away.
You’re on your back in your undershirt, a broken man on an ugly bedspread, staring at the water stains on the ceiling.
The problem is figuring out which part is the path and which part is the happiness.
A thing and a thing and a thing held still— you have to hold something still to find the other things. This is speculation.
Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.
Says to himself The boy's no good. The boy is just no good. but he takes you in his arms and pushes your flesh around to see if you could ever be ugly to him.
The booths are plush and the drinks are cheap and in this dim and smoky light you can barely tell whose hands are whose. Someone raises their glass for a toast. Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy?

You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.

You said Don’t be silly, so I followed you into the store. We were thumping the melons when I heard somebody say Nobody move!
the hollow boy passed out on the universal bedspread. Here he is again, being sewn up.
You were drinking sangria and I was throwing oranges at you, but it didn’t matter.
and you’ve kissed him, and he’ll never forgive you,
and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like you've discovered something you don't even have a name for.
I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything.
So, you kiss him, and he doesn’t move, he doesn’t pull away, and you keep on kissing him.
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want.
Your name is Jeff and somewhere up ahead of you your brother has pulled to the side of the road and he is waiting for you with a lug wrench clutched in his greasy fist.
You're dancing: you're neck and neck or cheek to cheek, he's there or he isn't, the open road. Imagine a room. Imagine you're dancing. Imagine the room now falling away. Don't move.
It's a matter of willpower. O little birds, you flap around and  make a mess of the milk-blue sky—
I find parts that overlap with mine and light them up in clays and creams, yellow music singing pink, the flicker of his mouth a purple rust.
The eye stretches to the horizon and then must continue up. Anything past the horizon is invisible, it can only be imagined.
I wanted to be thrown over, possessed.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk. Not because I don’t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I’m always saving and you’re always owing and I’m tired of asking to settle the debt.
Was I discovered or invented? asks the zero. Feels like I've always been here.
It reminds me of some tale, stay with me to remember, it reminds me of where I was going without you.
In your ruined shirt, on the last day, while the bruise won't heal, and the stain stays put, the red light streaming in from everywhere at once.
God says, Which one of you fuckers can get to me first?
It’s love or it isn’t. It isn’t over.

His shoulder blots out the stars but the minutes don’t stop. He covers my body with his body but the minutes don’t stop.
Yes, and he likes flipping the chairs, watching them fill with people. He likes the orange juice and toast of it, and waxed floors in any light.
Two brothers: one of them wants to take you apart. Two brothers: one of them wants to put you back together. It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
And then it's gone. Makes you sad. All your friends are gone. Goodbye Goodbye.

And he knew it wasn’t going to be okay, and he told me it wasn’t going to be okay.

The wind knocks the heads of the flowers together. Steam rises from every cup at every table at once.
A seaside framed in glass, and boats, those little boats with sails aflutter, shining lights upon the water, lights that splinter when they hit the pier.
And the boy who loves you the wrong way is filthy.
Consider the hairpin turn. It is waiting for you like a red door or the broken leg of a dog.
Something is not right about what I’m doing but I’m still doing it—living in the worst parts, ruining myself.

Hush, my sweet. These tornadoes are for you.

The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it. This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
I will stick the landing. There will be no confusion. The dead will make room for me.
This is my hand over his face, which isn’t his face anymore, revising.

We have been very brave, we have wanted to know the worst, wanted the curtain to be lifted from our eyes.

Sometimes, at night, in bed, before I fall asleep, I think about a poem I might write, someday, about my heart, says the heart.
Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.

Your skin looked blue in the television light. Your teeth looked yellow.

People like to think war means something.  What can you learn from your opponent? More than you think. Who will master this love? Love might be the wrong word.
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home.
Someone has to leave first. This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
Wearing your clothes or standing in the shower for over an hour, pretending that this skin is your skin, these hands your hands, these shins, these soapy flanks.

all of us watching, all of us wondering if these two boys will find a way to figure it out.
All painting is sent downstream, into the future.
Two brothers: one of them wants to take you apart. Two brothers: one of them wants to put you back together. It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?

Forget about his insides, his plumbing and his furnaces, put a thing in his hand and be done with it.

The mark on the floor from pushing your chair back, your underwear, one half brick of cheese, the kind I don't like, wrapped up, and poorly, and abandoned on the second shelf next to the poppyseed dressing, which is also yours.
You said Tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...
Let's say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men.
Here we are in the wrong tunnel, burn O burn, but it’s cold,
I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.

No more tears. I would like to meet you all in Heaven. But there's a litany of dreams that happens somewhere in the middle. Moonlight spilling on the bathroom floor.
Chemical names, bird names, names of fire and flight and snow, baby names, paint names, delicate names like bones in the body, Rumplestiltskin names that are always changing, names that no one’s ever able to figure out.
There are many names in history but none of them are ours.
there’s a niche in his chest  where a heart would fit perfectly, and he thinks if he could just maneuver one into place– well then, game over.
This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven,

Here is my hand, my heart, my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated cities at the center of me, and here is the center of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we can drink from, but I can’t go through with it.
Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish.
You, the moon. You, the road. You, the little flowers by the side of the road. You keep singing along to that song I hate. Stop singing.
It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
Someone's doing all the talking but no one's lips move. Consider the hairpin turn.

When I die, I will come in fast and low. I will stick the landing.
You were sitting in a bathtub at the hospital and you were crying. You said it hurt.
This dream going on with all of us in it. Penciling in the bighearted slob. Penciling in his outstretched arms.
A map without landmarks is useless. Science dreams its dreams of knowledge—names it, pokes it with equations.
The man on top of you is teaching you how to hate, sees you as a piece of real estate, just another fallow field lying underneath him like a sacrifice.
To be a man on a hill, or all the men on all the hills, or half a man shivering in the flock of himself. These are some choices.

This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
Hush, my sweet. These tornadoes are for you.

I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home. I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark. Sweetheart, is that you?

Forget about his insides, his plumbing and his furnaces, put a thing in his hand and be done with it.
If you have one apples and I take away one apples you have, zero apples and a sadness, says the sadness.
I will stick the landing. There will be no confusion. The dead will make room for me.
What does a body of knowledge look like? A body, any body.

He follows. Malaria. He dies three days before his pardon arrives and three days after Rembrandt’s fourth birthday.
You said I could have anything I wanted, but I  just couldn’t say it out loud.
You could drown in those eyes, I said, so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
This is the part where you wake up in your clothes again, this is the part where you’re trying to stay inside the building. Stay in the room for now, he says. Stay in the room for now.

This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you.
The water is flat, flat and calm, it seems a sheet of glass. You look at it, the more you look at it the more you feel like you are looking into your own head
He covers my body with his body
your hands a river gesture,
What does all this love amount to?
There’s a black dog and there’s a white dog, depends on which you feed, depends on which damn dog you live with.
A dark-haired man in a rented bungalow is licking the whiskey from the back of your wrist.

But you are my nomad and I love you sideways daily.
This time everyone has the best intentions. You have cancer. Let’s say you have cancer.

And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile.

He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him—
My shadow falls across his face, blue milk and pistachio, his eyes shine like wedding rings.
Take it or leave it, and for the most part you take it. Not just the idea of it but the ramifications of it.
You were lying in the middle of the empty highway. The sky was red and the sand was red and you were wearing a brown coat. There were flecks of foam in the corners of your mouth. The birds were watching you.
We have swallowed him up, they said. It's beautiful. It really is.
all I can do is stand on the curb and say Sorry about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.
All of us are trapped in our skins and drowning in gravity. Physics is unforgiving. Nature is predatory. We do not walk through a passive landscape.
It should be enough. To make something beautiful should be enough. It isn’t. It should be.
You asked me once, What are we made of? Well, these are the things we’re made of.
It starts with bloodshed, always bloodshed, always the same running from something larger than yourself story,
When I die, I will come in fast and low.

You are playing cards with three Jeffs. One is your father, one is your brother, and the other is your current boyfriend. All of them have seen you naked and heard you talking in your sleep.
I crawled out the window and ran into the woods.
Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.
Here is the river, and here is the box, and here are the monsters we put in the box to test our strength against.
I’d rather quit. I’d rather be sad. It’s too much work. Admirable? Not really.
In a word, in a phrase, it’s a movie, you’re the star. so smile for the camera, it’s your big scene, you know your lines.
I’m battling monsters, I’m pulling you out of the burning buildings and you say I’ll give you anything but you never come through.
I’ll use my body like a ladder, climbing to the thing behind it, saying farewell to flesh, farewell to everything caught underfoot and flattened.
Especially that, but I should have known.
You're in the hallway again. The radio is playing your favorite song. You're in the hallway. Open the door again. Open the door.

because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.
I’m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not  feeding yourself to a bad man  against a black sky prickled with small lights.
Do you love yourself? I don’t have to answer that. It should matter.
Imagine: Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it. You didn’t think you’d feel this way.
These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to clean them up like this.
My inner life is a sheet of black glass. If I fell through the floor I would keep falling.
and the tug of a simple profound sadness when it sounds so far away.
Your body told me in a dream it’s never been afraid of anything.
Don’t you see, it’s like I’ve swallowed your house keys, and it feels so natural, like the bullet was already there, like it’s been waiting inside me the whole time.
I wanted to fall down right there but I knew you wouldn’t catch me because you’re dead.

Let’s admit, without apology, what we do to each other. We know who our enemies are. We know.
This is where the evening splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish.
I looked at all the trees and didn’t know what to do.
Every morning the maple leaves.
And yes, he raises the moon on a crane and scrubs it until it shines. So what does it shine on?  Nothing.
then the question behind every question: What happens next?
The trees in wind, the streetlights on, the click and flash of cigarettes being smoked on the lawn, and just a little kiss before we say goodnight.
Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.
I want more applesauce. I want more seats reserved for heroes. Dear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
We pull our boots on with both hands but we can’t punch ourselves awake and all I can do is stand on the curb and say Sorry about the blood in your mouth.

If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder.
I will keep watch. I will water the yard. Knot the tie and go to work. Unknot the tie and go to sleep. I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
History repeats itself. Somebody says this. History throws its shadow over the beginning, over the desktop, over the sock drawer with its socks, its hidden letters.
The birds were watching you.
And I can’t eat, can’t sleep, can’t sit still or fix things and I wake up and I wake up and you’re still dead,
The booths are plush and the drinks are cheap and in this dim and smoky light you can barely tell whose hands are whose. Someone raises their glass for a toast. Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy?
Your body told me in a dream it’s never been afraid of anything.
There’s a thing in my stomach about this. A simple thing. The last rung.
I swallow your heart and you make me spit it up again. I swallow your heart and it crawls right out of my mouth.
suddenly darkness,  suddenly only darkness.
the roar of the freeway, the roar of the city sheening across the city. There should be a place.
If you don’t believe in God, then who are you talking to?
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder. One thing. Come closer. Listen...
I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
The musicians start the overture while I hide behind the microphone, trying to match the dubbing to the big lips shining down from the screen.
The sun shines down. It's a beautiful day. Consider the hairpin turn. Do not choose sides yet.
It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
How can you refuse Hands of fire, hands of air, hands of water, hands of dirt. Someone's doing all the talking but no one's lips move. Consider the hairpin turn.
These, our bodies, possessed by light.
I told you so. Yes, you did, dear.
and you're trembling, but he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist, and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like you've discovered something you don't even have a name for.
I watched TV. I had a Coke at the bar. I had four dreams in a row where you were burned, about to burn, or still on fire.
A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says: Walk a mile in my shoes.
You want an alibi? You don't get an alibi, you get two brothers. Here are two Jeffs. Pick one. This is how you make the meaning, you take two things and try to define the space between them.
Two of these Jeffs are windows, and two of these Jeffs are doors, and all of these Jeffs are trying to tell you something.
Makes a cathedral, him pressing against me, his lips at my neck, and yes, I do believe his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me like stars.
Someone once told me that explaining is an admission of failure. I’m sure you remember, I was on the phone with you, sweetheart.
History repeats itself. Somebody says this. History throws its shadow over the beginning, over the desktop, over the sock drawer with its socks, its hidden letters.
I’m saying your name in the grocery store, I’m saying your name on the bridge at dawn.
he keeps saying I owe you, says Your shoes are filling with your own damn blood, you must want something, just tell me, and it’s yours.
The clock ticks from five to six. Kissing degenerates into biting.
Love, for you, is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion.
The dark rang loud. Underground: cold blazing.
Oh, the things we invent when we are scared and want to be rescued.
It could have been so beautiful—you scout out the road ahead and I will watch your back, how it was and how it will be, memory and fantasy— but each Jeff wants to be the other one.
Here is the hallway and here are the doors and here is the fear of the other thing, the relentless thing, your body drowning in gravity.
your hands a river gesture, the birds in flight, the birds still singing outside the greasy window, in the trees.
I clawed my way into the light but the light is just as scary. I’d rather quit. I’d rather be sad. It’s too much work.
The dawn was breaking the bones of your heart like twigs.
Hush, my sweet. These tornados are for you.
And the boy who loves you the wrong way keeps weakening.
These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to clean them up like this.
It should be enough. To make something beautiful should be enough. It isn’t. It should be.
Desire driving his hands right into your body.
I swear, I end up feeling empty, like you’ve taken something out of me, and I have to search my body for the scars, thinking Did he find that one last tender place to sink his teeth in?
a suit of fur, a coat of mud, a kick in the pants, a lungful of glass, the sails in wind and the slap of waves on the hull
I take it back.  The wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.  I take them back.
A pause, a road, the taste of gravel in the mouth. The rocks dig into my skin like arrowheads.
Solve means isolate. Solve means conquer.
Tell me we’re dead and I’ll love you even more. I’m surprised that I say it with feeling.
A man with a bandage is in the middle of something. Everyone understands this. Everyone wants a battlefield.
So, you kiss him, and he doesn’t move, he doesn’t pull away, and you keep on kissing him.
The hand sings weapon. The mind says tool. The body swerves in the service of the mind, which is evidence of the mind but not actual proof.
the old dull pain, whose stitched wrists and clammy fingers, far from being subverted, had only slipped underneath us, freshly scrubbed.
We make these ridiculous idols so we can pray to what's behind them, but what happens after we get up the ladder? Do we simply stare at what's horrible and forgive it?
We carve up the world and crown it with numbers—lumens, ounces, decibels.
he’ll never forgive you, and maybe now he’ll never leave you alone.
I’m sorry it’s such a lousy story.
You said I could have anything I wanted, but I just couldn’t say it out loud. Actually, you said Love, for you, is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’s terrifying. No one will ever want to sleep with you.
It seems the phone was ringing in the dream you were having but there's no proof. A dish in the sink that might be yours, some clothes on the floor that might belong to someone else.
A man says to another man, There is something I have to tell you. No, says the other man. No, you don't.
We knocked the heads off the statuary, deprived the landmarks of any meaning. Victory swelling in the occupation. History is painted by the winners.
then the question behind every question: What happens next?
It's getting late, Little Moon. Finish the song. It's not that late.
This is where the evening splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish.
The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for.
Lovers do the looking while strangers look away.
It made no sense. When you have nothing to say, set something on fire. A blurry landscape is useless.
I think I’d rather keep the bullet this time. It’s mine, you can’t have it, see, I’m not giving it up.
No one  will ever want to sleep with you.
This is a story of loops, at least one. I stepped off the loop.
Here and there and what to do about it.
We've read the back of the book, we know what's going to happen. The fields burned, the land destroyed, the lovers left broken in the brown dirt. And then it's gone. Makes you sad. All your friends are gone. Goodbye Goodbye.
This is not what we meant to be.
Do I have to stick my tongue in your mouth like the hand of a thief, like a burglary like it’s just another petty theft?
Mirrors and shop windows returned our faces to us, replete with the tight lips and the eyes that remained eyes and not the doorways we had hoped for.
The birds were watching you.
We like things related to our survival: soup, arrows— they expand the range of the species. Goldmine, goldmine, landmine.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
We carve up the world and crown it with numbers—lumens, ounces, decibels.
I’m not the princess either.  Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
There wasn’t much left but it felt like him, wild and scared. It was too much to bear.
My head just sat there. Fair enough.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder. One thing. Come closer. Listen...
And you can hear the man in the apartment above you taking off his shoes. You hear the first boot hit the floor and you’re looking up, you’re waiting
The musicians start the overture while I hide behind the microphone, trying to match the dubbing to the big lips shining down from the screen.
Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this— swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
I surrender my desire to be healed. The blurriness of being alive.
What a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon.  Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly  flames everywhere.
Here's the champagne on the floor, and here are your house keys, and here are the curtains that your cat peed on. And here is your cat, who keeps eating grass and vomiting in the hallway.
But you are my nomad and I love you sideways daily. Sideways because I have to beam my love in all directions, hoping it bounces off something and eventually finds you.
Henry with a needle and thread, hovering over the hollow boy passed out on the universal bedspread.
And then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view  of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts.
Sometimes there is noise an sometimes song and often there is silence, the long tunnel, the sea like glass...
There were some nice parts, sure,  all lemondrop and mellonball, laughing in silk pajamas  and the grains of sugar  on the toast, love love or whatever, take a number.
It's getting late, Little Moon. Finish the song. It's not that late.
When the man who was not my father divorced my mother, I stopped being related to him. These things are complicated, says the Talmud. When he died, I couldn’t prove it. I couldn’t get a death certificate. These things are complicated, says the Health Department.
You have a cold cold smile.
My shadow falls across him and it doesn’t go away.
You had a bottle of pills but I wouldn’t let you swallow them. You said Will you love me even more when I'm dead?
You want a better story. Who wouldn’t?
Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it.
Names like pain cries, names like tombstones, names forgotten and reinvented, names forbidden or overused.
Dear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you.  Quit milling around the yard and come inside.
No more tears. I would like to meet you all in Heaven. But there's a litany of dreams that happens somewhere in the middle. Moonlight spilling on the bathroom floor.
And there's snow on the TV, a landscape full of snow, falling from the fire-colored sky.  But thanks, thanks for calling it the blue sky
Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating.
I took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I’d just as soon kill you myself, I say.
I have my body and you have yours. Believe it if you can. Negative space is silly.
I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark, hunched over on the wooden chair in the kitchen, listening to the rain.
His hands keep turning into birds, and his hands keep flying away from him.
Inside your head the sound of glass,  a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
Something’s not right about what I’m doing but I’m still doing it– living in the worst parts, ruining myself.
The way it's night for many miles, and then suddenly it's not, it's breakfast and you're standing in the shower for over an hour, holding the bar of soap up to the light.
But damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills.
Left hand raising the fork to the mouth, feeling the meat slide down your throat, thinking My throat. Mine. Everything in this cone of light is mine.
Solve means isolate. Solve means conquer.
So, you kiss him, and he doesn’t move, he doesn’t pull away, and you keep on kissing him.
You raised your hand to your face as if to hide it, the pink fingers gone gold as the light streamed straight to the bone, as if you were the small room closed in glass with every speck of dust illuminated.
This time everyone has the best intentions. You have cancer. Let's say you have cancer. Let's say you've swallowed a bad thing and now it's got its hands inside you. This is the essence of love and failure.
This is also part of the story: how the story changes. This is something I forgot to tell you.
Still wet, I lay down next to you. Your arms, your legs, your naked chest, your ribs delineated like a junkyard dogs.
… the hunter’s heart, the hunter’s mouth, the trees and the trees and the space between the trees, swimming in gold.
It’s time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
And I can’t eat, can’t sleep, can’t sit still or fix things and I wake up and I wake up and you’re still dead,
Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.  You still get to be the hero.
And words, little words, words too small for any hope or promise, not really soothing but soothing nonetheless.
They weren’t animals but they looked like animals, enough like animals to make it confusing, meant something but the meaning was slippery:
Eventually the birds must land.
What would you like? I’d like my money’s worth.
he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist,
Putting down the brush for the last time--
I took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I’d just as soon kill you myself, I say.
Two brothers: one of them wants to take you apart. Two brothers: one of them wants to put you back together. It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
Let's say the Devil is played by two men. We'll call them Jeff. Dark hair, green eyes, white teeth, pink tongues—they're twins.
In your ruined shirt, on the last day, while the bruise won't heal, and the stain stays put, the red light streaming in from everywhere at once.
shoving money into the jaws of a suitcase, cutting your hair with a steak knife at a rest stop, and you're off, you're on the run,
When you bang on the wall you have to remember you’re on both sides of it already but go ahead, yell at yourself.
I woke up in the morning and I didn’t want anything, didn’t do anything, couldn’t do it anyway, just lay there listening to the blood rush through me and it never made any sense, anything.
So you get a kidney punch, a little blood in your urine. It isn’t over yet, it’s just begun.
You start counting at one, not zero, which is wrong, says the moon.
Never finish a war without  starting another. I’ve seen your  true face: the back of your head.  If you were walking away, keep walking.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you've done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you're tired.
You were drinking sangria and I was throwing oranges at you, but it didn’t matter.
In these dreams it’s always you: the boy in the sweatshirt, the boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me from jumping off the bridge.
It’s time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
I’d rather quit. I’d rather be sad. It’s too much work. Admirable? Not really.
I went to the riverbed to wait for you to show up. You didn’t show up. I kept waiting.
What are you still doing in this field? Get out of the field! You should be in the hotel room! You should, at least, be trying to get back into the hotel room. Ah! Now the field is empty.
Your broken ribs, the back of your head, your hand to mouth or hand to now, right now, like you mean it, like it's splitting you in two. Now look at the lights, the lights.
A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says: Walk a mile in my shoes.
Your mother is pretending that she hasn't seen anything. Your father is fiddling with the knobs of the radio. There is an empty space next to you in the backseat of the station wagon. Make it the shape of everything you need. Now say hello.
I'm thinking My plant, his chair, the ashtray that we bought together. I'm thinking This is where we live.
It's a road movie, a double-feature, two boys striking out across America, while desire, like a monster, crawls up out of the lake
Your jeep. Your teeth. The coffee that you bought me. The sandwich cut in half on the plate.
We walked through the house to the elevated train.  All these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful  mechanical wind.
Consider the hairpin turn. It is waiting for you like a red door or the broken leg of a dog.
The life of the mind is a disappointment, but remember what stands for what.
Says to himself The boy's no good. The boy is just no good. but he takes you in his arms and pushes your flesh around to see if you could ever be ugly to him.
I threw the pills on the sand. Look at them, you said. They look like emeralds.
I'm thinking This is where we live.
I never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way, and I don’t want to be the kind that says the wrong way. But it doesn’t work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and you're trying not to tell him that you love him,
I will turn myself into a gun, because it’s all I have, because I’m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own.
shut up  I’m getting to it.
Your body told me in a dream it’s never been afraid of anything.
You are lying on your back, on the top bunk, very close to the textured ceiling, staring straight at it in fact, and the room is still dark except for a wedge of powdery light that spills in from the adjoining bathroom.
A man says to another man, Can I tell you something? The other man says, No.
A man saw a bird and wanted to paint it. The problem, if there was one, was simply a problem with the question. Why paint a bird? Why do anything at all?
I touch myself, I dream.
This is good advice. He couldn’t do it. There is no way to get to the future from here.
your breath on my neck like a music that holds my hands down, kisses as they burn their way along my spine —
You're in the hallway again. The radio is playing your favorite song. You're in the hallway. Open the door again. Open the door.
Who do you love, Jeff? Who do you love? You were driving toward something and then, well, then you found yourself driving the other way. The dog is asleep. The road is behind you. O how the sun shines down.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him— green eyes flecked with yellow, dried leaves on the surface of a pool—
He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
You can sleep now, you said. You can sleep now. You said that. I had a dream where you said that. Thanks for saying that. You weren’t supposed to.
Trees outside the window and a big band sound that makes you feel like everything's okay, a feeling that lasts for one song maybe, the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.
how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces.
We deduce  backward into first causes—stone in the pond of things, splash splash—or we throw ourselves into the future.
So the doctor says you need more stitches and the bruise cream isn't working. So much for the facts. Let's say you're still completely in the dark but we love you anyway. We love you. We really do.
so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
you don’t trust him to love you in a way you would enjoy.
A dark-haired man in a rented bungalow is licking the whiskey from the back of your wrist.
Is there an acceptable result? Do we mean something when we talk? Is it enough that we are shuddering from the sound?
Imagine: Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it. You didn’t think you’d feel this way.
When I die, I will come in fast and low.
The machine of the world––if you don’t grab on, you begin to tremble. And if you do grab on, then everything trembles.
You keep saying I owe you, I owe... but you say the same thing every time. Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
The sun shines down. It's a beautiful day. Consider the hairpin turn. Do not choose sides yet.
You can’t get out of this one, Henry, you can’t get it out of me, and with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, I will turn myself into a gun, because I’m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own.
Let's say you're not in the field anymore. Let's say they're not brothers anymore. That's right, they're not brothers, they're just one guy, and he knows you, and he's talking to you, but you're in pain and you cannot understand him.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven, which brings us back to the hero's shoulders and the gentleness that comes, not from the absence of violence, but despite the abundance of it.
You, the moon. You, the road. You, the little flowers by the side of the road. You keep singing along to that song I hate. Stop singing.
I came to tell you, we’ll swim in the water, we’ll swim like something sparkling underneath the waves.
Here is my hand, my heart, my throat, my wrist.
The way it's night for many miles, and then suddenly it's not, it's breakfast and you're standing in the shower for over an hour, holding the bar of soap up to the light.
There were some nice parts, sure,  all lemondrop and mellonball, laughing in silk pajamas  and the grains of sugar  on the toast, love love or whatever, take a number.
These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to clean them up like this.
so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
he’ll never forgive you, and maybe now he’ll never leave you alone.
To be a man on a hill, or all the men on all the hills, or half a man shivering in the flock of himself. These are some choices.
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party.  Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party
and this is the map of my heart, the landscape after cruelty which is, of course, a garden, which is a tenderness, which is a room, a lover saying Hold me tight, it's getting cold.
Two of these Jeffs are windows, and two of these Jeffs are doors, and all of these Jeffs are trying to tell you something.
You cannot get in the way of anyone's path to God.
You wanted to be in love and he happened to get in the way.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder.
I looked at the trees and didn’t know what to do.  A box made out of leaves.  What else was in the woods? A heart, closing.
I borrowed your shoes and didn’t put them away. You were crying and eating rice.
From the landscape: a sense of scale. From the dead: a sense of scale.
Even when I look away I am still looking. He is inside his body and I am inside my body and it matters less and less.
I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark, hunched over on the wooden chair in the kitchen, listening to the rain.
Names of poisons, names of handguns, names of places we’ve been together, names of people we’d be together,
If there was one thing I could save from the fire, he said, the broken arms of the sycamore, the eucalyptus still trying to climb out of the yard —
I like him and I want to be like him, my hands no longer an afterthought.
Jeff is thinking about his brother down the winding road behind  him. He is thinking that if only he could cut him open and peel him back and crawl inside this second skin, then he could relive that last mile again: reborn, wild-eyed, free.
A pause, a road, the taste of gravel in the mouth. The rocks dig into my skin like arrowheads.
Why live a life? Well, why are you asking?
Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy?
Don’t you see, it’s like I’ve swallowed your house keys, and it feels so natural, like the bullet was already there, like it’s been waiting inside me the whole time.
The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...
No one wants to know what’s in his head. It should be enough.
Let me tell you a story about war.
You cannot get in the way of anyone's path to God.
You just wanted to prove there was one safe place, just one safe place where you could love him. You have not found that place yet. You have not made that place yet. You are here. You are here. You're still right here.
Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. These, our bodies, possessed by light.
We have swallowed him up, they said. It's beautiful. It really is.
I have my body and you have yours. Believe it if you can. Negative space is silly.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here,
This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall.
The way we move through time and space, or only time.
Forget the dragon,  leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.
Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake and dress them in warm clothes again.
Let’s admit, without apology, what we do to each other. We know who our enemies are. We know.
I wanted to explain myself to myself in an understandable way. I gave shape to my fears and made excuses.
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home. I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark. Sweetheart, is that you?
Once, night, unchallenged, extended its dark grace across the sky.
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
A man says to another man, Can I tell you something? The other man says, No.
Let’s say you’ve swallowed a bad thing and now it’s got its hands inside you. This is the essence of love and failure.
Come closer. We’ll whisper it in your ear.
This is the place, you say to yourself, this is the place where everything starts to begin, the wounds reveal a thicker skin and suddenly there is no floor.
Take a body, maybe your own, and dump it gently. All your dead, unfinished selves and dump them gently.
I thought I heard the clink of ice to teeth. I thought I heard the clink of teeth to glass.
He is looking at the wall and I am looking at his looking. Difficult thing, to be scrutinized so long.
The hand sings weapon. The mind says tool. The body swerves in the service of the mind, which is evidence of the mind but not actual proof.
The yard is dark, the tomatoes are next to the whitewashed wall, the book on the table is about Spain, the windows are painted shut.
All night the wind blows through the trees. It makes a sound.
You had expected something else, anything else, but the wrench never reaches you. It hangs in the air like that, spinning in the air like that. It's beautiful.
He has a body but it doesn’t matter, clean sheets on the bed but it doesn’t matter.
Our father who art in Heaven. Our father who art buried in the yard. Someone is digging your grave right now.
The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater
The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it. This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
Maybe we will wake up to the silence of shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.
and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces.
Okay, if you’re so great, you do it—  here’s the pencil, make it work...
And the part where I push you  flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,  shut up, I’m getting to it.
I couldn’t make you love me and I’m tired of pulling your teeth.
Not because I don’t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I’m always saving and you’re always owing and I’m tired of asking to settle the debt.
So how would you catalog it? Dawn in the fields? Snow and dirty rain? Light brought in in buckets?
I will come back from the dead for you.
This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
There will be no confusion. The dead will make room for me.
your name like a boat in the sea of love — O now we’re in the sea of love!
I cut off my head and threw it on the ground. I walked away. This is how we measure, walking away.
you play along, because you want to die for love, you always have.
Like taking the same picture over and over, the spaces in between sealed up—
There is a ghost at the end of the song.
but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,  while I’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,  and getting stabbed to death.
You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that, and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me you love this, tell me you're not miserable.
A man walks into a bar and says: Take my wife–please. But you take him instead. You take him home, and you make him a cheese sandwich, and you try to get his shoes off, but he kicks you and he keeps kicking you.
I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything, without having to say that I ran out into the street to prove something, that he didn’t love me,
It’s time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
I am only repeating what I heard. This is one love. There are many loves but only one war.
But you are my nomad and I love you sideways daily.
Faith in snow, bravery in snow… / We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
This is good advice. He couldn’t do it. There is no way to get to the future from here.
You can’t paint the inside of anything, so why would you try? Painting the inside of anything is dangerous.
I turned away from darkness to see daylight, to see what would happen. What happened? What does a man want?
Here is the river, and here is the box, and here are the monsters we put in the box to test our strength against.
You see them through the backseat window as you and your parents drive past. You are twelve years old. You do not have a brother. You have never experienced anything this ferocious or intentional with another person.
Hello darling, sorry about that.
And then the second boot falls. And then a third, a fourth, a fifth.
You're going to die in your best friend's arms. And you play along because it's funny, because it's written down, you've memorized it, it's all you know.
the roar of the freeway, the roar of the city sheening across the city. There should be a place.
Those trees lined up like that, and the way the stars are spinning over them like that, spinning in the air like that, like wrenches.
Finding the dots, connecting the dots. An interrogation of the dots. A pip, a point, a seed, a stone.
I was away, I don't know where, lying on the floor, pretending I was dead. I wanted to hurt you but the victory is that I could not stomach it.
Wanted for murder, a price on his head, Caravaggio does what he always does—he tries to paint his way out of it.
Brother, dead brother, who speaks to him in dreams. These are a few things worth saying.
he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist,
You can sleep now, you said. You can sleep now. You said that. I had a dream where you said that. Thanks for saying that. You weren’t supposed to.
He wants to be tender and merciful. That sounds overly valorous. Sounds like penance. And his hands? His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him. Him being you.
Lovers do the looking while strangers look away.
Chemical names, bird names, names of fire and flight and snow, baby names, paint names, delicate names like bones in the body, Rumplestiltskin names that are always changing, names that no one’s ever able to figure out.
your name like a boat in the sea of love — O now we’re in the sea of love!
His hands keep turning into birds, and his hands keep flying away from him. Eventually the birds must land.
Here is the black box, the shut eye, the bullet pearling in his living skin.
When you paint an evil thing, do you invoke it or take away its power?
If you love me, you don't love me in a way that I understand.
I cut off my head and threw it in the sky. It turned into birds. I called it thinking.
You were very beautiful.
War, and the art of war, and the landscape of war. Grant me freedom from objects, says the painting. I will help you, says the paint.
If the dead are watching, I want them to see us writing, dancing, singing, painting. I want them to see that we still reach out to each other.
I stayed as long as I could, he said. Now look at the moon.
So, you kiss him, and he doesn't move, he doesn't pull away, and you keep on kissing him. And he hasn't moved, he's frozen, and you've kissed him, and he'll never forgive you, and maybe now he'll leave you alone.
I will keep watch. I will water the yard. Knot the tie and go to work. Unknot the tie and go to sleep. I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
The fact of his pulse, the way he pulled his body in, out of shyness or shame or a desire not to disturb the air around him.
Here he is again, being sewn up.
You said Tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...
Here is the hallway and here are the doors and here is the fear of the other thing, the relentless thing, your body drowning in gravity.
You’re welcome, says the landscape. Gold bodies on the red, red ground. I paint in the wounds.
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
Okay, if you’re so great, you do it—  here’s the pencil, make it work...
I swallow your heart and it crawls right out of my mouth.
You see them through the backseat window as you and your parents drive past. You are twelve years old. You do not have a brother. You have never experienced anything this ferocious or intentional with another person.
War, and the art of war, and the landscape of war. Grant me freedom from objects, says the painting. I will help you, says the paint.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him—
Forget the dragon,  leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.
He doesn’t know what to do with his hands. He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.  I walk through your dreams and invent the future.
You miss the point: the face in the mirror is a little traitor, the face in the mirror is a pale and naked hostage and no one can tell which room he’s being held in.
I do believe his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me like stars.
I will stick the landing. There will be no confusion. The dead will make room for me.
His hands keep turning into birds, and his hands keep flying away from him. Eventually the birds must land.
Someone's doing all the talking but no one's lips move. Consider the hairpin turn.
The way you slam your body into mine reminds me I'm alive, but monsters are always hungry, darling, and they're only a few steps behind you,
You are feeling things he’s no longer in touch with.
How do I tell you how I got here without getting trapped in the past?
Here is the river, and here is the box, and here are the monsters we put in the box to test our strength against.
The wife had died of sadness, by her own hand. The father walks out of the room and the room is almost empty.
I told you so. Yes, you did, dear.
Was I discovered or invented? asks the zero. Feels like I've always been here.
Let’s admit, without apology, what we do to each other. We know who our enemies are. We know.
and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which twin you are in love with at the time.
Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.  You still get to be the hero.
The sun is shining, O how the sun shines down!
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart? and you said Kiss me.
Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. These, our bodies, possessed by light. Tell me we’ll never get used to it.
No one  will ever want to sleep with you.
It’s time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
Eventually, he was forced to divorce her. Then, he died. Then she did. The man was not my father. My father was buried down the road, in a box his other son selected, the ashes of his third wife in a brass urn that he will hold in the crook of his arm forever.
A man had two birds in his head—not in his throat, not in his chest—and the birds would sing all day never stopping. The man thought to himself, One of these birds is not my bird. The birds agreed.
Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too…
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you've done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you're tired.
It seems the phone was ringing in the dream you were having but there's no proof. A dish in the sink that might be yours, some clothes on the floor that might belong to someone else.
Do I have to stick my tongue in your mouth like the hand of a thief, like a burglary like it’s just another petty theft?
What does a body of knowledge look like? A body, any body.
Tonight, by the freeway, a man eating fruit pie with a buckknife carves the likeness of his lover’s face into the motel wall.
Hush, my sweet. These tornados are for you.
His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him. Him being you.
In the wrong light anyone can look like a darkness.
there’s a niche in his chest  where a heart would fit perfectly, and he thinks if he could just maneuver one into place– well then, game over.
You thought if you handed over your body he’d do something interesting.
People don't learn anything unless they are afraid of being left behind, says the suitcase.
I never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way, and I don’t want to be the kind that says the wrong way. But it doesn’t work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats.
Here is my hand, my heart, my throat, my wrist.
I took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I’d just as soon kill you myself, I say.
headlights shining in all directions, night spilling over them like gasoline in all directions,
Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy?
The best part of spirituality is reverence. There are other parts.
But damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills.
He's turning your back into a table so he doesn't have to eat off the floor, so he can get comfortable, pressing against you until he fits, until he's made a place for himself inside you.
I walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure,  I sink the boat of love, but that comes later.
Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.
His shoulder blots out the stars but the minutes don’t stop. He covers my body with his body but the minutes don’t stop.
Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?  Let me do it right for once,
You had a bottle of pills but I wouldn’t let you swallow them. You said Will you love me even more when I'm dead?
All these things happened. Allegedly.
But the minutes don’t stop. The prayer of going nowhere going nowhere.
It should be enough. To make something beautiful should be enough. It isn’t. It should be.
It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster. That’s a nice touch, stains in the night,
Oh, the things we invent when we are scared and want to be rescued.
He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand. He was dead anyway, a ghost. I'm surprised I saw his hand at all.
No more tears. I would like to meet you all in Heaven. But there's a litany of dreams that happens somewhere in the middle. Moonlight spilling on the bathroom floor.
This time everyone has the best intentions. You have cancer. Let’s say you have cancer.
I’ll use my body like a ladder, climbing to the thing behind it, saying farewell to flesh, farewell to everything caught underfoot and flattened.
Look away but I’m still there. Birds flying but I’m still there.
They looked at the sky, and at the mud, and at their hands in the mud, and their dead friends in the mud. This went on for a long time.
and you realize the one person in the world who loves you isn’t the one you thought it would be,
Wanted for murder, a price on his head, Caravaggio does what he always does—he tries to paint his way out of it.
The mark on the floor from pushing your chair back, your underwear, one half brick of cheese, the kind I don't like, wrapped up, and poorly, and abandoned on the second shelf next to the poppyseed dressing, which is also yours.
It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
I wanted to take him home and rough him up and get my hands inside him, drive my body into his like a crash test car.
I try to guess your trajectory and end up telling my own story.  We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
Looking back is easy for a while and then looking back gets murky. There is the road, and there is the story of where the road goes, and then more road,
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home. I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark. Sweetheart, is that you?
It’s time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
It’s another wrong-man-dies scenario and we keep doing it, Henry, keep saying until we get it right... but we always win and we never quit.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven, which brings us back to the hero's shoulders
Clench is a hand word. His hand is clenched.
O how he loves you, darling boy. O how, like always, he invents the monsters underneath the bed to get you to sleep next to him, chest to chest or chest to back, the covers drawn around you in an act of faith against the night.
To them he is a mirror, but to you he is a room.
Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it.
headlights shining in all directions, night spilling over them like gasoline in all directions,
The dead will make room for me.
You asked me once, What are we made of? Well, these are the things we’re made of.
Suppose for a moment we are crowded around a pier, waiting for something to ripple the water. We believe in you. There is no danger. It is not getting dark, we want to say.
the slap of waves on the hull of a boat that’s sinking to the sound of mermaids singing songs of love,
Disheartening? Obviously. I hope it’s love. I’m trying really hard to make it love. I said no more severity.
Everyone needs a place. You need it for the moment you need it, then you bless it— and move on. Who does this? No one.
How much can you change and get away with it, before you turn into someone else, before it’s some kind of murder?
And angels, about twelve angels, angels knocking on your head right now, hello hello, a flash in the sky, would you like to meet him there, in Heaven?
No more tears. I would like to meet you all in Heaven. But there's a litany of dreams that happens somewhere in the middle. Moonlight spilling on the bathroom floor.
Do we simply stare at what's horrible and forgive it?
suddenly darkness,  suddenly only darkness.
We make these ridiculous idols so we can pray to what's behind them, but what happens after we get up the ladder? Do we simply stare at what's horrible and forgive it?
It was night for many miles and then the real stars in the purple sky, like little boats rowed out too far, begin to disappear.
how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces.
I turned away from darkness to see daylight, to see what would happen. What happened? What does a man want?
We have come back from Jerusalem where we found not  what we sought, so do it over, give me another version,  a different room, another hallway, the kitchen painted over  and over,
I arrived in the city and you met me at the station,  smiling in a way that made me frightened.
You’re climbing out of the chlorinated pool again.
You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds. Look—white fluffy clouds.
And I can’t eat, can’t sleep, can’t sit still or fix things and I wake up and I wake up and you’re still dead,
Is that all? No, there were other attempts, breakfasts: plates served, plates carried away.
There is no light in the paint, so how can you argue with them? They are probably right anyway.
Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there.
My dragonfly, my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart,
Drink it, the bartender says. It's yours, you deserve it. It's already been paid for. Somebody's paid for it already. There's no mistake, he says. It's your drink, the one you asked for, just the way you like it.
Leave a trail of letters like those little knots of bread we used to dream about. We used to dream about them. We used to do a lot of things.
Your name like a song I sing to myself, your name like a box where I keep my love, your name like a nest in the tree of love,
This boy, half-destroyed, screaming Drive into that tree, drive off the embankment.
I take it back.  The wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.  I take them back.
I’m a romantic, an absurdist. I am bad with facts and I get confused. I’m a hostile witness. I didn’t want to see this, talk about this. I wanted to testify to something else.
green eyes flecked with yellow, dried leaves on the surface of a pool— You could drown in those eyes, I said.
The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it.
At home: the moon delivered.
There is a fulcrum in the mind that can be moved as well. I do not know what else to say about this.
Here is the cake, and here is the fork, and here's the desire to put it inside us, and then the question behind every question: What happens next?
Is that too much to expect? That I would name the stars for you? That I would take you there? The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube?
Finding the dots, connecting the dots. An interrogation of the dots. A pip, a point, a seed, a stone.
You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar.
and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces
Take a body, dump it, drive.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which twin you are in love with at the time.
Sometimes there is noise an sometimes song and often there is silence, the long tunnel, the sea like glass...
It’s another wrong-man-dies scenario and we keep doing it, Henry, keep saying until we get it right... but we always win and we never quit.
Measure yourself against truth and not the other way around, says the ghost.
Love, for you, is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion.
The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it.
Four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, fall down right there. I wanted to fall down right there but I knew you wouldn’t catch me because you're dead. I swallowed crushed ice pretending it was glass and you're dead. Ashes to ashes.
We’re filming the movie called Planet of Love- there’s sex of course, and ballroom dancing, fancy clothes and waterlilies in the pond,
You wanted to be cremated so we cremated you and you wanted an adventure so I ran and I knew you wouldn’t catch me.
My inner life is a sheet of black glass. If I fell through the floor I would keep falling.
You're dancing: you're neck and neck or cheek to cheek, he's there or he isn't, the open road. Imagine a room. Imagine you're dancing. Imagine the room now falling away. Don't move.
You see what I mean but you're happy anyway, and that's okay, it's a love story after all, a lasting love, a wonderful adventure with lots of action, where the mirror says mirror and the hand says hand and the front door never says Sorry Charlie.
Your name like a song I sing to myself, your name like a box where I keep my love, your name like a nest in the tree of love, your name like a boat in the sea of love — O now we’re in the sea of love!
Let’s say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men. Here: I’ll be all of them—Jeff and Jeff and Jeff
Sometimes there is noise an sometimes song and often there is silence, the long tunnel, the sea like glass...
Want something to chase you? Run. Take a body, dump it, drive. Take a body, maybe your own, and dump it gently.
There were some nice parts, sure,  all lemondrop and mellonball, laughing in silk pajamas  and the grains of sugar  on the toast, love love or whatever, take a number.
If the dead are watching, I want them to see us writing, dancing, singing, painting. I want them to see that we still reach out to each other.
Let’s say you’re driving down the road with your eyes closed but my eyes are also closed. You’re by the side of the road.
Okay, if you’re so great, you do it—  here’s the pencil, make it work...
I swallow your heart and it crawls right out of my mouth.
The night sky is vast and wide.
He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand.
And there's snow on the TV, a landscape full of snow, falling from the fire-colored sky.  But thanks, thanks for calling it the blue sky
All night I stretched my arms across him, rivers of blood, the dark woods, singing with all my skin and bone
I couldn’t get the boy to kill me, but I wore his jacket for the longest time.
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts  from one foot to the other.
Your jeep. Your teeth. The coffee that you bought me. The sandwich cut in half on the plate.
So how would you catalog it? Dawn in the fields? Snow and dirty rain? Light brought in in buckets?
Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all  forgiven, even though we didn’t deserve it.
Do you want it? Do you want anything I have? Will you throw me to the ground like you mean it, reach inside and wrestle it out with your bare hands?
Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there.
I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark, hunched over on the wooden chair in the kitchen, listening to the rain.
I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark, hunched over on the wooden chair in the kitchen, listening to the rain.
I'm thinking This is where we live.
We do not walk through a passive landscape. The paint dries eventually. The bodies decompose eventually.
He puts his hands all over you to keep you in the room. It’s night. It’s noon. He’s driving. It’s happening all over again.
The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you,
I swallowed crushed ice pretending it was glass and you’re dead. Ashes to ashes.
I mean, maybe it’s better if my opponent wins.
This is my hand over his face, which isn’t his face anymore, revising.
Tired and sore and rubbed the wrong way, rubbed raw and throbbing in the light. They want to stop but they don’t stop.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and you're trying not to tell him that you love him, and you're trying to choke down the feeling, and you're trembling,
This is not what we meant to be.
Faith in snow, bravery in snow… / We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
History repeats itself. Somebody says this.
This has nothing to do with faith but is still a good question.
Let’s admit, without apology, what we do to each other. We know who our enemies are. We know.
Sometimes I draw you with fangs. I tell you these things because I love you.
The motorbikes are neck and neck but where's the checkered flag we all expected, waving in the distance, telling you you're home again, home?
Someone is digging your grave right now.
Knocked hard enough to make the record skip and change its music, setting the melody on its forward course again,
Why live a life? Well, why are you asking?
I'll give you my heart to make a place for it to happen, evidence of a love that transcends hunger.
It's a matter of willpower. O little birds, you flap around and  make a mess of the milk-blue sky—
At home: the moon delivered.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which Jeff you are.
I followed myself for a long while, deep into the field. Two heads full of garbage.
Was I discovered or invented? asks the zero. Feels like I've always been here.
You are playing cards with three Jeffs. One is your father, one is your brother, and the other is your current boyfriend. All of them have seen you naked and heard you talking in your sleep.
But we both know how it goes––I say I want you inside me and you hold my head underwater, I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
Four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, fall down right there. I wanted to fall down right there but I knew you wouldn’t catch me because you’re dead.
The night is cold, it is silver, it is a coin.
I’m saying your name in the grocery store, I’m saying your name on the bridge at dawn.
And I can't eat, can't sleep, can't sit still or fix things and I wake up and I wake up and you're still dead, you’re under the table, you’re still feeding the damn dog, you're cutting the room in half. Whatever. Feed him whatever. Burn the straw house down.
He has a body but it doesn’t matter, clean sheets on the bed but it doesn’t matter.
I came to tell you, we’ll swim in the water, we’ll swim like something sparkling underneath the waves.
My dragonfly, my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart,
Still wet, I lay down next to you. Your arms, your legs, your naked chest, your ribs delineated like a junkyard dogs.
You said I could have anything I wanted, but I  just couldn’t say it out loud.
There is a ghost at the end of the song.
When she saw herself, finished, she said, It doesn’t look like me. Picasso said, It will.
but here we are in the weeds again, here we are in the bowels of the thing: your world doesn’t make sense.
All night the trees stand silent in the dark, not touching.
And no one can ever figure out what you want, and you won't tell them, and you realize the one person in the world who loves you isn't the one you thought it would be, and you don't trust him to love you in a way you would enjoy.
Suppose for a moment we are crowded around a pier, waiting for something to ripple the water. We believe in you. There is no danger. It is not getting dark, we want to say.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you.
I carried you to the car and drove you home but you weren’t making any sense.
All painting is sent downstream, into the future.
I just don’t want to die anymore.
sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell  and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.
After everything that was going to happen has happened you ask only for the cab fare home and realize you should have asked for more because he couldn't care less, either way.
you are ready to die in this swimming pool because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means your life is over anyway.
You can’t paint the inside of anything, so why would you try? Painting the inside of anything is dangerous.
Hold onto your voice. Hold onto your breath. Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.
Tell me we’re dead and I’ll love you even more.
I'm thinking This is where we live.
God says, Which one of you fuckers can get to me first?
I have learned to understand this sound.
I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
The enormity of my desire disgusts me.
You had a bottle of pills but I wouldn’t let you swallow them. You said Will you love me even more when I'm dead?
I threw the pills on the sand. Look at them, you said. They look like emeralds.
While you're deciding, the afternoon light is streaming through the windows behind the bank of checkout counters. Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.
And there's snow on the TV, a landscape full of snow, falling from the fire-colored sky.  But thanks, thanks for calling it the blue sky
You’re welcome, says the landscape. Gold bodies on the red, red ground. I paint in the wounds.
We collide with place, which is another name for God, and limp away with a permanent injury.
We clutch our bellies and roll on the floor... When I say this, it should mean laughter,  not poison.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
His voice on tape, his name on the envelope, the soft sound of a body falling off a bridge behind you, the body hardly even makes a sound.
I take it back.  The wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.  I take them back.
It wasn’t until we were well past the middle of it that we realized the old dull pain, whose stitched wrists and clammy fingers,
Two of these Jeffs are windows, and two of these Jeffs are doors, and all of these Jeffs are trying to tell you something.
Let’s say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men. Here: I’ll be all of them—Jeff and Jeff and Jeff
Dear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you.  Quit milling around the yard and come inside.
The sun shines down. It's a beautiful day. Consider the hairpin turn. Do not choose sides yet.
If you don’t believe in God, then who are you talking to?
There should be a place. At the rest stop, in the restaurant, the overpass, the water’s edge...
No one wants to know what’s in his head. It should be enough.
They're hurling their bodies down the freeway to the smell of gasoline, which is the sound of a voice saying I told you so.
Wanted for murder, a price on his head, Caravaggio does what he always does—he tries to paint his way out of it.
suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness.
Cut me open and the light streams out. Stitch me up and the light keeps streaming out between the stitches.
Why take more than we need? Because we can. Deep footprint, it leaves a hole. You’d break your heart to make it bigger, so why not crack your skull when the mind swells?
I like him and I want to be like him, my hands no longer an afterthought.
I think I’d rather keep the bullet this time. It’s mine, you can’t have it, see, I’m not giving it up.
and then you don't remember where you've been, and you find yourself down the hall again, the lights gone dim as the left hand sings the right hand back to sleep.
Then you wanted pasta, so we trampled out into the tomatoes and rolled around to make the sauce.
Here is a map with a your name for a capital, here is an arrow to prove a point:
Disheartening? Obviously. I hope it’s love. I’m trying really hard to make it love. I said no more severity.
Open the door and the light falls in. Open your mouth and it falls right out again.
The wife had died of sadness, by her own hand. The father walks out of the room and the room is almost empty.
The hand sings weapon. The mind says tool. The body swerves in the service of the mind, which is evidence of the mind but not actual proof.
so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
so I said What do you want, sweetheart? and you said Kiss me.
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart?
Hold onto your voice. Hold onto your breath. Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
Here we are in the wrong tunnel, burn O burn, but it’s cold,
Maybe a salad? Spinach, walnuts, blue cheese, apples, and you can't decide between the Extra Large or Jumbo black olives. Which is bigger anyway? Extra Large has a blue label, Jumbo has a purple label. Both cans cost $1.29.
Every morning the maple leaves.
Here I am leaving you clues. I am singing now while Rome burns. We are all just trying to be holy.
I watched TV. I had a Coke at the bar. I had four dreams in a row where you were burned, about to burn, or still on fire.
The stranger says there are no more couches and he will have to sleep in your bed. You try to warn him, you tell him you will want to get inside him, and ruin him, but he doesn't listen.
Measure yourself against truth and not the other way around, says the ghost.
swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
And everyone secretly wants to collaborate with the enemy, to construct a truer version of the self.
To them he is a mirror, but to you he is a room.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven, which brings us back to the hero's shoulders and the gentleness that comes, not from the absence of violence, but despite the abundance of it.
It starts with bloodshed, always bloodshed, always the same running from something larger than yourself story,
Everyone needs a place. You need it for the moment you need it, then you bless it— and move on. Who does this? No one.
You saved my life he says, I owe you everything.
You said, tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon.
The other brother only wants to stitch you back together.
They want to stop but they don’t stop. They cannot get the bullet out. Cut me open and the light streams out. Stitch me up and the light keeps streaming out between the stitches.
Jeff is thinking about his brother down the winding road behind  him. He is thinking that if only he could cut him open and peel him back and crawl inside this second skin, then he could relive that last mile again: reborn, wild-eyed, free.
I'm thinking This is where we live.
shut up  I’m getting to it.
The man on top of you is teaching you how to hate, sees you as a piece of real estate, just another fallow field lying underneath him like a sacrifice.
Every morning the same big  and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out  You will be alone always and then you will die.
I don’t really blame you for being dead but you can’t have your sweater back.
None of it is real, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up singing. Maybe we will wake up to the silence Of shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.
I ran and I knew you wouldn’t catch me. You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.
There's a niche in his chest where a heart would fit perfectly
I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
The surface of the water was still and bright. Your feet were burning so I put my hands on them, but my hands were burning too.
The surface of the water was still and bright. Your feet were burning so I put my hands on them, but my hands were burning too.
And then the second boot falls. And then a third, a fourth, a fifth.
I kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.
He’s on top of you. He’s next to you, right next to you in fact. He has the softest skin wrapped entirely around him. It isn't him
You said Tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...
You know what it’s like to be alone: gimlets and vermicide. You know what it’s like to be alive, so forgiveness.
And everyone secretly wants to collaborate with the enemy, to construct a truer version of the self.
You had expected something else, anything else, but the wrench never reaches you. It hangs in the air like that, spinning in the air like that. It's beautiful.
They swarm the field and their painted flags unfurl. Crown yourself with leaves and stake your claim before something smears up the paint.
The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube?
And there, in the distance, not the promised land, but a Holiday Inn, with bougainvillea growing through the chain link by the pool.
Imagine you are in a field of daisies. What are you doing in a field of daisies? Get up!
I take off my hands and I give them to you but you don’t want them, so I take them back and put them on the wrong way, the wrong wrists.
So you say you want a deathbed scene, the knowledge that comes  before knowledge, and you want it dirty.
I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything,
I'm thinking My plant, his chair, the ashtray that we bought together. I'm thinking This is where we live.
It wasn’t until we were well past the middle of it that we realized the old dull pain, whose stitched wrists and clammy fingers,
A man with a bandage is in the middle of something. Everyone understands this. Everyone wants a battlefield.
He wants to be tender and merciful. That sounds overly valorous. Sounds like penance. And his hands? His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him. Him being you.
Forget the dragon,  leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.
I swear, I end up feeling empty, like you’ve taken something out of me, and I have to search my body for the scars, thinking Did he find that one last tender place to sink his teeth in?
And the part where I push you  flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,  shut up, I’m getting to it.
I try to guess your trajectory and end up telling my own story.  We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell  and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.
My name is Jeff and I'm tired of looking at the back of your head. My name is Jeff and I'm tired of seeing my hand me down clothes.
The man on top of you is teaching you how to hate, sees you as a piece of real estate, just another fallow field lying underneath him like a sacrifice.
This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
Let’s say you’re driving down the road with your eyes closed but my eyes are also closed. You’re by the side of the road.
A man saw a bird and wanted to paint it. The problem, if there was one, was simply a problem with the question. Why paint a bird? Why do anything at all?
A man saw a bird and wanted to paint it. The problem, if there was one, was simply a problem with the question. Why paint a bird? Why do anything at all?
You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds. Look—white fluffy clouds.
You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that, and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me you love this, tell me you're not miserable.
This went on for a long time.
I know you want me to say it, Henry, it’s in the script, you want me to say Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too... but I think I’d rather keep the bullet.
Every morning the same big  and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out  You will be alone always and then you will die.
The waters of the dead, a clear road, every lover in the form of stars, the road blocked.
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home. I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark. Sweetheart, is that you?
Look, Jeff, I'm telling you, for the last time, I mean it, etcetera. They are the same and they are not the same. They are the same and they hate each other for it.
You cannot have an opponent if you keep saying yes.
We have not been given all the words necessary. We have not been given anything at all. We’ve been driving all night. We’ve been driving a long time. We want to stop. We can’t.
We like things related to our survival: soup, arrows— they expand the range of the species. Goldmine, goldmine, landmine.
Here and there and what to do about it.
We’ve made a graveyard out of the bone white afternoon.
You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things. You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do long division, and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do,
a fugitive driving away from something shameful and half-remembered.
Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.
Everyone needs a place. It shouldn’t be inside of someone else. I kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.
I looked at all the trees and didn’t know what to do.
All night the wind blows through the trees. It makes a sound.
So now we have come to a great battlefield, the warmth of the fire, the fire still burning, the heat escaping like a broken promise.
Let me tell you a story about war.
you don’t trust him to love you in a way you would enjoy.
Deep-wounded mind, I wasn’t doing anything with it anyway. And the birds looking for a place to land. I
The door swung wide: twin beds, twin lamps, twin plastic cups wrapped up in cellophane and he says No Henry, let’s not do this.
If there was one thing I could save from the fire, he said, the broken arms of the sycamore, the eucalyptus still trying to climb out of the yard —
I put my sadness in a box. The box went soft and wet and weak at the bottom.
It’s good to give explicit answers, showing all the steps, necessary and sufficient.
You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar.
Jeff is thinking about his brother down the winding road behind  him. He is thinking that if only he could cut him open and peel him back and crawl inside this second skin, then he could relive that last mile again: reborn, wild-eyed, free.
There is nothing interesting about the sea.
There are two twins on motorbikes but they are not on motorbikes, they're in a garden where the flowers are as big as thumbs.
People like to think war means something.  What can you learn from your opponent? More than you think. Who will master this love? Love might be the wrong word.
We are all going forward. None of us are going back.
I crawled out the window and ran into the woods.
My dragonfly, my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart,
but tell me you love this, tell me you’re not miserable.
The wind blows and it makes a noise. Pain makes a noise. We bang on the pipes and it makes a noise. Was there no one else?
Dear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you.  Quit milling around the yard and come inside.
The night sky is vast and wide.
What does all this love amount to?
The waters of the dead, a clear road, every lover in the form of stars, the road blocked.
To have a thought, there must be an object— the field is empty, sloshed with gold, a hayfield thick with sunshine.
We’ve made a graveyard out of the bone white afternoon.
Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.
You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things. You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do long division, and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy,
You miss the point: the face in the mirror is a little traitor, the face in the mirror is a pale and naked hostage and no one can tell which room he’s being held in.
Someone once told me that explaining is an admission of failure. I’m sure you remember, I was on the phone with you, sweetheart.
the roar of the freeway, the roar of the city sheening across the city. There should be a place.
He follows. Malaria. He dies three days before his pardon arrives and three days after Rembrandt’s fourth birthday.
We have swallowed him up, they said. It's beautiful. It really is.
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
Two brothers: one of them wants to take you apart. Two brothers: one of them wants to put you back together.
Why live a life? Well, why are you asking?
And everyone secretly wants to collaborate with the enemy, to construct a truer version of the self.
Someone once told me that explaining is an admission of failure.
Midnight June. Midnight July. They’ve been going at it for days now. Getting the bullet out.
A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says: Walk a mile in my shoes.
So you get a kidney punch, a little blood in your urine. It isn’t over yet, it’s just begun.
Tired and sore and rubbed the wrong way, rubbed raw and throbbing in the light. They want to stop but they don’t stop.
Cut off your head, kid. For all the good it'll do ya. I glued my head back on.
These, our bodies, possessed by light. Tell me we’ll never get used to it.
A man walks into a bar and says: Take my wife–please. So you do.
Rely on one thing too long and when it disappears you have nothing--well, that's just bad planning.
The machine of the world––if you don’t grab on, you begin to tremble. And if you do grab on, then everything trembles.
Accidents never happen when the room is empty. Everyone understands this. Everyone needs a place.
A man had two birds in his head—not in his throat, not in his chest—and the birds would sing all day never stopping. The man thought to himself, One of these birds is not my bird. The birds agreed.
He covers my body with his body
the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.
Come closer. We'll whisper it in your ear. It's like seeing your face in a bowl of soup, cream of potato, and the eyes shining back like spoons.
or rain, our bodies wet, clothes clinging arm to elbow, clothes clinging nipple to groin — I’ll be right here. I’m waiting.
You swallow a bottle of sleeping pills but they don’t work. Boots continue to fall to the floor in the apartment above you.
The moon, of course, is always there—
People don't learn anything unless they are afraid of being left behind, says the suitcase.
I swear, I end up feeling empty, like you’ve taken something out of me, and I have to search my body for the scars, thinking Did he find that one last tender place to sink his teeth in?
Every morning the same big  and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out  You will be alone always and then you will die.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road. Let's call them Jeff.
The night is cold, it is silver, it is a coin.
Especially that, but I should have known.
Inside your head you hear a phone ringing and when you open your eyes only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer. Inside your head the sound of glass, a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
Inside your head you hear a phone ringing and when you open your eyes only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer. Inside your head the sound of glass, a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
But we both know how it goes––I say I want you inside me and you hold my head underwater, I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
Shame means you’re guilty, like the rest of us, but you think you’re better than we are.
Sometimes I draw you with fangs. I tell you these things because I love you.
The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater
I said my arms are very long and your head’s on fire. I said kiss me here and here and here And you did.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him—
sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud. Especially that, but I should have known.
We've read the back of the book, we know what's going to happen. The fields burned, the land destroyed, the lovers left broken in the brown dirt. And then it's gone. Makes you sad. All your friends are gone. Goodbye Goodbye.
Here is the river, and here is the box, and here are the monsters we put in the box to test our strength against.
A man says to another man, There is something I have to tell you. No, says the other man. No, you don't.
Everyone needs a place. You need it for the moment you need it, then you bless it— and move on. Who does this? No one.
what’s there to be faithful to? I am faithful  to you, darling. I say it to the paint.
This boy, half-destroyed, screaming Drive into that tree, drive off the embankment.
The train station blue, your lips blue, hands cold and the blue wind. Or a horse, your favorite horse now raised up again out of the mud and galloping, galloping always toward you.
The musicians start the overture while I hide behind the microphone, trying to match the dubbing to the big lips shining down from the screen.
Your name like an animal covered with frost, your name like a music that’s been transposed,
Eventually the birds must land.
You came to me while we were sleeping, we were both sleeping, and you asked me to hold this for you. I am holding this for you.
The man on top of you is teaching you how to hate, sees you as a piece of real estate, just another fallow field lying underneath him like a sacrifice.
This is philosophy. These are suppositions. If one has no apples, one has zero apples. There is, you see, no shortage of open problems.
The mind fights the  body and the body fights the land.
And he knew it wasn’t going to be okay, and he told me it wasn’t going to be okay.
You are feeling things he’s no longer in touch with.
We have come back from Jerusalem where we found not  what we sought, so do it over, give me another version,  a different room, another hallway, the kitchen painted over  and over,
This dream going on with all of us in it. Penciling in the bighearted slob. Penciling in his outstretched arms.
Hello darling, sorry about that.
Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish.
This is not what we meant to be.
This is good advice. He couldn’t do it. There is no way to get to the future from here.
This is good advice. He couldn’t do it. There is no way to get to the future from here.
The stranger says there are no more couches and he will have to sleep in your bed. You try to warn him, you tell him you will want to get inside him, and ruin him, but he doesn't listen.
Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I’m getting at?
When the man who was not my father divorced my mother, I stopped being related to him. These things are complicated, says the Talmud. When he died, I couldn’t prove it. I couldn’t get a death certificate. These things are complicated, says the Health Department.
There should be just one safe place in the world, I mean this world. People get hurt here.
Let's say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men.
None of it is real, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up singing.
Someone's doing all the talking but no one's lips move. Consider the hairpin turn.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
I burst into tears and flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed canopied with devastated clouds.
your breath on my neck like a music that holds my hands down, kisses as they burn their way along my spine —
But angels are pouring out of the farmland, angels are swarming over the grassland, Angels rising from their little dens, arms swinging, wings aflutter, dropping their white-hot bombs of love.
you’re waiting because you thought it would follow, you thought there would be some logic, perhaps, something to pull it all together
I know you want me to say it, Henry, it’s in the script, you want me to say Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too... but I think I’d rather keep the bullet.
You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and you’re trying not to tell him that you love him, and you’re trying to choke down the feeling, and you’re trembling,
Tell me we’ll never get used to it.
Your skin looked blue in the television light. Your teeth looked yellow.
I'll give you my heart to make a place for it to happen, evidence of a love that transcends hunger.
You cannot get in the way of anyone's path to God.
I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
I’m not the princess either.  Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
This is not harmless, the how to touch it, we do not want the screen completely lifted from our eyes, just lifted long enough to see the holes.
I’m bleeding, I’m not just making conversation.
Inside your head you hear  a phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you’re washing up  in a stranger’s bathroom,
your name with two X’s to mark the spots, to hold the place, to keep the treasure from becoming ever lost.
Every story has its chapter in the desert, the long slide from kingdom to kingdom through the wilderness, where you learn things, where you're left to your own devices.
a suit of fur, a coat of mud, a kick in the pants, a lungful of glass, the sails in wind and the slap of waves on the hull
Something is not right about what I’m doing but I’m still doing it—living in the worst parts, ruining myself.
The voice wants to be a hand and the hand wants to do something useful. What did you really want?
I’m battling monsters, I’m pulling you out of the burning buildings and you say I’ll give you anything but you never come through.
I want to give you more but not everything. You don't need everything.
The paint doesn’t move the way the light reflects, so what’s there to be faithful to?
Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too…
Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.
There's a part in the movie where you can see right through the acting, where you can tell that I'm about to burst into tears, right before I burst into tears and flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed canopied with devastated clouds.
swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
What do you do with a man like that? While you are deciding, more men ride in.
Here is the river, and here is the box, and here are the monsters we put in the box to test our strength against.
because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.
They all have perfect teeth: white, square, clean, even. And, for some reason, the lighting in the room makes their teeth seem closer than they should be, as if each mouth was a place, a living room with pink carpet and the windows open.
There’s smashed glass glittering everywhere like stars.
Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake and dress them in warm clothes again. How it was late, and no one could sleep,
A seaside framed in glass, and boats, those little boats with sails aflutter, shining lights upon the water, lights that splinter when they hit the pier.
we laugh and it pits the world against us,
And everyone secretly wants to collaborate with the enemy, to construct a truer version of the self.
I’ve seen your true face: the back of your head.
And all my fingers turned to twigs. Inside himself he jumped a little.
I cut off my head and threw it in the sky. It turned into birds. I called it thinking.
The life of the mind is a disappointment, but remember what stands for what.
You wanted to be in love and he happened to get in the way.
I’m saying your name in the grocery store, I’m saying your name on the bridge at dawn.
You said I could have anything I wanted, but I  just couldn’t say it out loud.
I will keep watch. I will water the yard. Knot the tie and go to work. Unknot the tie and go to sleep. I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
They look like me. I move them around. I prefer to blame others, it’s easier. King me.
Here we are in the wrong tunnel, burn O burn, but it’s cold,
The other brother only wants to stitch you back together.
We do not walk through a passive landscape. The paint dries eventually. The bodies decompose eventually.
the gentleness that comes, not from the absence of violence, but despite the abundance of it.
The way it's night for many miles, and then suddenly it's not, it's breakfast and you're standing in the shower for over an hour, holding the bar of soap up to the light.
You take her out into the rain and you fall in love with her and she leaves you and you’re desolate.
You take her out into the rain and you fall in love with her and she leaves you and you’re desolate.
Do we simply stare at what's horrible and forgive it?
I’d rather quit. I’d rather be sad. It’s too much work. Admirable? Not really.
Someone to pass this with me. You wanted more. I want what everyone wants.
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
Boots continue to fall to the floor in the apartment above you.
You get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!  What more do you want?
The life of the mind is a disappointment, but remember what stands for what.
I turned my back on the story. A sense of superiority. Everything casts a shadow.
This is where he trots out his sadness. Little black cloud, little black umbrella.
The night is cold, it is silver, it is a coin.
His voice on tape, his name on the envelope, the soft sound of a body falling off a bridge behind you, the body hardly even makes a sound.
How do I tell you how I got here without getting trapped in the past?
Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.
I looked out the window and said This doesn’t look that much different from home, because it didn’t, but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.
All these things and what to do with them. We carve up the world all the time.
shut up  I’m getting to it.
all I can do is stand on the curb and say Sorry about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.
This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you.
This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you.
a suit of fur, a coat of mud, a kick in the pants, a lungful of glass, the sails in wind and the slap of waves on the hull
Here: I'll be all of them—Jeff and Jeff and Jeff and Jeff are standing on the shoulder of the highway, four motorbikes knocked over, two wrenches spinning in the ordinary air.
Someone has to leave first. This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
Especially that, but I should have known.
but more frequently I was finding myself sleepless, and he was running out of lullabies.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
War, and the art of war, and the landscape of war. Grant me freedom from objects, says the painting. I will help you, says the paint.
Close your eyes. A lover is standing too close to focus on. Leave me blurry and fall toward me with your entire body.
This is not what we meant to be.
Smeared night, smudged dawn. I saw him fall. Them, falling. Split and felled and pounded into the ground.
The train station blue, your lips blue, hands cold and the blue wind. Or a horse, your favorite horse now raised up again out of the mud and galloping, galloping always toward you.
Finding the dots, connecting the dots. An interrogation of the dots. A pip, a point, a seed, a stone.
I wanted to be wanted and he was very beautiful, kissed with his eyes closed, and only felt good while moving.
Tonight you’re thinking of cities under crowns of snow and I stare at you like I’m looking through a window, counting birds.
He follows. Malaria. He dies three days before his pardon arrives and three days after Rembrandt’s fourth birthday.
None of it is real, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up singing. Maybe we will wake up to the silence Of shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.
It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
Those trees lined up like that, and the way the stars are spinning over them like that, spinning in the air like that, like wrenches.
Tired and sore and rubbed the wrong way, rubbed raw and throbbing in the light. They want to stop but they don’t stop.
Can you see them pressed into the gravel, pressed into the dirt, pressing against each other in an effort to make the minutes stop—
War, and the art of war, and the landscape of war. Grant me freedom from objects, says the painting. I will help you, says the paint.
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart?
It's a puzzle: each piece, each room, each time you put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, your ear to the wound that whispers.
You were very beautiful.
Color bleeds, so make it work for you. Gravity pulls, so make it work for you.
You're going to die in your best friend's arms. And you play along because it's funny, because it's written down, you've memorized it, it's all you know.
I kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.
Maybe a salad? Spinach, walnuts, blue cheese, apples, and you can't decide between the Extra Large or Jumbo black olives. Which is bigger anyway? Extra Large has a blue label, Jumbo has a purple label. Both cans cost $1.29.
This is the place, you say to yourself, this is the place where everything starts to begin, the wounds reveal a thicker skin and suddenly there is no floor.
I think I’d rather keep the bullet. It’s mine, see, I’m not giving it up. This way you still owe me, and that’s as good as anything.
Why live a life? Well, why are you asking?
So, you kiss him, and he doesn't move, he doesn't pull away, and you keep on kissing him. And he hasn't moved, he's frozen, and you've kissed him, and he'll never forgive you, and maybe now he'll leave you alone.
He knows that when you snap a mast it's time to get a set of oars or learn to breathe underwater.
I am still talking to you about help. I still do not have  these luxuries. I have told you where I’m coming from, so put it together.
What does a body of knowledge look like? A body, any body.
Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it.
I’d rather quit. I’d rather be sad. It’s too much work. Admirable? Not really.
You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar.
I take off my hands and I give them to you but you don’t want them, so I take them back and put them on the wrong way, the wrong wrists.
Can you see the plot like dotted lines across the room? Here is the sink to wash away the blood, here’s the whiskey, the ripped-up shirt, the tile of the bathroom floor, the disk of the drain
Black cherries in chocolate, the ring around the moon, a beetle underneath a glass—you cannot make out all the words, but you're sure he knows you're in there, and he's singing to you, even though you don't know who he is.
We are all just trying to be holy.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk. Not because I don’t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I’m always saving and you’re always owing and I’m tired of asking to settle the debt.
It's a matter of willpower. O little birds, you flap around and  make a mess of the milk-blue sky—
… the hunter’s heart, the hunter’s mouth, the trees and the trees and the space between the trees, swimming in gold.
To them he is a mirror, but to you he is a room.
I will keep watch. I will water the yard. Knot the tie and go to work. Unknot the tie and go to sleep. I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
I’ve seen your true face: the back of your head.
Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it.
Never finish a war without starting another.
Do we simply stare at what's horrible and forgive it?
I thought I heard the clink of ice to teeth. I thought I heard the clink of teeth to glass.
Hello darling, sorry about that. Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud. Especially that, but I should have known.
Who gets the whip and who gets the hoops of flame? He hits you and he hits you and he hits you.
He was dead anyway, a ghost. I'm surprised I saw his hand at all.
I put my sadness in a box. The box went soft and wet and weak at the bottom.
the light on his skin and bouncing off his skin.
Sure, I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow  glass, but that comes later.
His insides and his outsides kept apart with an imaginary line— thick and rude and imaginary because there is no separation, fallacy of the local body
Your skin looked blue in the television light. Your teeth looked yellow.
I’m battling monsters, half-monkey, half-tarantula, I’m pulling you out of the burning buildings and you say I’ll give you anything. But you never come through.
Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it.
Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.
Hush, my sweet. These tornados are for you.
There’s a gun in your hand. It feels hot. It feels oily.
You could drown in those eyes, I said, so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
You could drown in those eyes, I said, so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
shut up  I’m getting to it.

I looked at the trees and didn’t know what to do.

Shame means you’re guilty, like the rest of us, but you think you’re better than we are.

There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road. Let's call them Jeff.
There is a fulcrum in the mind that can be moved as well. I do not know what else to say about this.
Your name like a song I sing to myself, your name like a box where I keep my love, your name like a nest in the tree of love,
And then the sense of being smothered underneath a sack of lentils or potatoes, or of a boat at night slamming into the dock again without navigation, without consideration,
But we both know how it goes––I say I want you inside me and you hold my head underwater, I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
The radio aches a little tune that tells the story of what the night is thinking. It’s thinking of love.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder. One thing. Come closer. Listen...
You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds. Look—white fluffy clouds.
Let’s say you’re still completely in the dark but we love you anyway. We love you. We really do.
You were burned, you were about to burn, you’re still on fire.
His wounds healed, the skin a bit thicker than before, scars like train tracks on his arms and on his body underneath his shirt.
In the dream I don’t tell anyone, I’m afraid to wake you up.
All painting is sent downstream, into the future.
Two brothers are fighting by the side of the road. Two motorbikes have fallen over on the shoulder, leaking oil into the dirt, while the interlocking brothers grapple and swing.
Build me a city and call it Jerusalem. Build me another and call it  Jerusalem.
Here I am leaving you clues. I am singing now while Rome burns. We are all just trying to be holy.
A forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.  Love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.
You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things. You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do long division, and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do,
Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.
I find parts that overlap with mine and light them up in clays and creams, yellow music singing pink, the flicker of his mouth a purple rust.
What does a body of knowledge look like? A body, any body.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder.
I kissed my mouth, it was no longer a mouth. I threw a spear at my head, I didn’t have a head.
so I said What do you want, sweetheart? and you said Kiss me.
I think I’d rather keep the bullet. It’s mine, see, I’m not giving it up. This way you still owe me, and that’s as good as anything.

You take him home, and you make him a cheese sandwich, and you try to get his shoes off, but he kicks you and he keeps kicking you.
All of us are trapped in our skins and drowning in gravity. Physics is unforgiving. Nature is predatory. We do not walk through a passive landscape.
Don’t you see, it’s like I’ve swallowed your house keys, and it feels so natural, like the bullet was already there, like it’s been waiting inside me the whole time.
I stayed as long as I could, he said. Now look at the moon.

All the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly  darkness, suddenly only darkness.
suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness.
Down the alley, around the arcade,  up the stairs of the building  to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things,
O how he loves you, darling boy. O how, like always, he invents the monsters underneath the bed to get you to sleep next to him, chest to chest or chest to back, the covers drawn around you in an act of faith against the night.
Some say God is where we put our sorrow. God says, Which one of you fuckers can get to me first?
Chemical names, bird names, names of fire and flight and snow, baby names, paint names, delicate names like bones in the body, Rumplestiltskin names that are always changing, names that no one’s ever able to figure out.
I leaned over and whispered in your ear I told you so.
Precise. A landmark. You might like it here.  I think that you might like it here.
And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile.
Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours.
Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours.
What would you like? I’d like my money’s worth. Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this— swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
You swallowing matches and suddenly I’m yelling Strike me. Strike anywhere.
Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there.
We collide with place, which is another name for God, and limp away with a permanent injury.
I took a shower and tried to catch my breath. You were lying on top of the bedspread in boxer shorts, watching cartoons and laughing but not making any sound.
They swarm the field and their painted flags unfurl. Crown yourself with leaves and stake your claim before something smears up the paint.
sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell  and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.
the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.
I wanted to fall down right there but I knew you wouldn’t catch me because you’re dead.
The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for.

Suppose for a moment that the heart has two heads, that the heart has been chained and dunked in a glass booth filled with river water.
he keeps saying I owe you, says Your shoes are filling with your own damn blood, you must want something, just tell me, and it’s yours.
and then you don't remember where you've been, and you find yourself down the hall again, the lights gone dim as the left hand sings the right hand back to sleep.
A thought bigger than your own head. Try it. Seriously. Cover more ground.
You said Don’t be silly, so I followed you into the store. We were thumping the melons when I heard somebody say Nobody move!
Those trees lined up like that, and the way the stars are spinning over them like that, spinning in the air like that, like wrenches.
All night I stretched my arms across him, rivers of blood
We have been very brave, we have wanted to know the worst, wanted the curtain to be lifted from our eyes.

There's a niche in his chest where a heart would fit perfectly
Do I have to stick my tongue in your mouth like the hand of a thief, like a burglary like it’s just another petty theft?
Imagine this: You’re driving. The sky’s bright. You look great.
I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything, without having to say that I ran out into the street to prove something, that he didn’t love me,
The entire history of human desire takes about seventy minutes to tell.
Let’s jump ahead to the moment of epiphany, in gold light, as the camera pans to where the action is, lakeside and backlit, and it all falls into frame, close enough to see the blue rings of my eyes as I say something ugly.
We have swallowed him up, they said. It's beautiful. It really is.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder.
Come back from the window, Jefferson. Take off those wet clothes and come over here, by the fire.

I looked at the trees and didn’t know what to do.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
All night the wind blows through the trees. It makes a sound.
Suppose for a moment that the heart has two heads, that the heart has been chained and dunked in a glass booth filled with river water.
A pause, a road, the taste of gravel in the mouth. The rocks dig into my skin like arrowheads.
The clock ticks from five to six. Kissing degenerates into biting.
He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand. He was dead anyway, a ghost. I'm surprised I saw his hand at all.
He likes the feel of the coffeepot. More than the hacksaw? Yes, and he likes flipping the chairs, watching them fill with people.
The one in front will want to take you apart, and slowly. His deft and stubby fingers searching every shank and lock for weaknesses. You could love this boy with all your heart.
My dragonfly, my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart,
There is no way to make this story interesting.
A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says: Walk a mile in my shoes.
What do you do with a man like that? While you are deciding, more men ride in.
I never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way, and I don’t want to be the kind that says the wrong way. But it doesn’t work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats.
He puts his hands all over you to keep you in the room. It’s night. It’s noon. He’s driving. It’s happening all over again.

A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says: Make it a double.
I crawled out the window and ran into the woods.
Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we  lived here,
Here we are in the wrong tunnel, burn O burn, but it’s cold,
I mean, maybe it’s better if my opponent wins.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which Jeff you are.
Is that too much to expect? That I would name the stars for you? That I would take you there?

Our bodies shivering, and the sound of our breathing, and the shore so far away.

And everyone secretly wants to collaborate with the enemy, to construct a truer version of the self.
Imagine this: You’re pulling the car over. Somebody’s waiting.

There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road. Let's call them Jeff.
You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that, and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me you love this, tell me you're not miserable.

He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him—

Is that too much to expect? That I would name the stars for you? That I would take you there?
I carried you to the car and drove you home but you weren’t making any sense.

Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.

the slap of waves on the hull of a boat that’s sinking to the sound of mermaids singing songs of love,
And everyone secretly wants to collaborate with the enemy, to construct a truer version of the self.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which Jeff you are.
If you have one apples and I take away one apples you have, zero apples and a sadness, says the sadness.
Let's say the Devil is played by two men. We'll call them Jeff. Dark hair, green eyes, white teeth, pink tongues—they're twins.
His shoulder blots out the stars but the minutes don’t stop.
Never finish a war without  starting another. I’ve seen your  true face: the back of your head.  If you were walking away, keep walking.
I was away, I don't know where, lying on the floor, pretending I was dead. I wanted to hurt you but the victory is that I could not stomach it.
It's a fairy tale, the story underneath the story, sliding down the polished halls, lightning here and gone.
It could have been so beautiful—you scout out the road ahead and I will watch your back, how it was and how it will be, memory and fantasy— but each Jeff wants to be the other one.
and half the night you're a dependable chap, mounting the stairs in lamplight to the bath, but then the too white teeth all night, all over the human sky, too much to bear, this constant fingering,
a fugitive driving away from something shameful and half-remembered.
Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there.
I know history. There are many names in history but none of them are ours.
So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog  of non-definitive acts, something other than the desperation.
You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds. Look—white fluffy clouds.
Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall.
Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.
It wasn’t until we were well past the middle of it that we realized the old dull pain, whose stitched wrists and clammy fingers,
You were sitting in a bathtub at the hospital and you were crying. You said it hurt.
Forget about his insides, his plumbing and his furnaces, put a thing in his hand and be done with it.
Names of endurance, names of devotion, street names and place names and all the names of our dark heaven crackling in their pan.
Hello darling, sorry about that.
Here is the list with all of your names, Jeff. They're not the same name, Jeff. They're not the same at all.
Trees outside the window and a big band sound that makes you feel like everything's okay, a feeling that lasts for one song maybe, the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.
We deduce  backward into first causes—stone in the pond of things, splash splash—or we throw ourselves into the future.
Lying on the sofa with my eyes closed, I didn’t want to see it this way, everything eating everything in the end.
You will be alone always and then you will die.
Desire driving his hands right into your body. Hush, my sweet. These tornados are for you.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven,
This is not harmless, the how to touch it, we do not want the screen completely lifted from our eyes, just lifted long enough to see the holes.
There are many names in history but none of them are ours.
Not because I don’t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I’m always saving and you’re always owing and I’m tired of asking to settle the debt.
Someone has to leave first. This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.
You're dancing: you're neck and neck or cheek to cheek, he's there or he isn't, the open road. Imagine a room. Imagine you're dancing. Imagine the room now falling away. Don't move.
So, I said, now that we have our dead, what are we going to do with them?
I’m the director. I’m in a helicopter. I have a megaphone and you play along, because you want to die for love, you always have.
You are lying on your back, on the top bunk, very close to the textured ceiling, staring straight at it in fact, and the room is still dark except for a wedge of powdery light that spills in from the adjoining bathroom.
You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened. Your co-workers ask if everything’s okay and you tell them you’re just tired.
I can tell already you think I’m the dragon,  that would be so like me, but I’m not. I’m not the dragon.
Desire driving his hands right into your body.
I made this place for you. A place for you to love me. If this isn't a kingdom then I don't know what is.
You said I could have anything I wanted, but I just couldn’t say it out loud. Actually, you said Love, for you, is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’s terrifying. No one will ever want to sleep with you.
This is where the evening splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish.
Red. And a little more red.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
And all my fingers turned to twigs. Inside himself he jumped a little.
And he knew it wasn’t going to be okay, and he told me it wasn’t going to be okay.
and half the night you're a dependable chap, mounting the stairs in lamplight to the bath, but then the too white teeth all night, all over the human sky, too much to bear, this constant fingering,
all of us watching, all of us wondering if these two boys will find a way to figure it out.
the window closing tight against the dirty rain.
A man walks into a bar and says: Take my wife–please. So you do.
We clutch our bellies and roll on the floor... When I say this, it should mean laughter,  not poison.

you play along, because you want to die for love, you always have.
And yes, he raises the moon on a crane and scrubs it until it shines. So what does it shine on?  Nothing.
Putting down the brush for the last time--
You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that, and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me you love this, tell me you're not miserable.
Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there.
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home.
Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.
I watched TV. I had a Coke at the bar. I had four Cokes, four dreams in a row.
What can you know about a person? They shift in the light. You can’t light up all sides at once.
People get hurt here. People fall down and stay down and I don’t like the way the song goes.
but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,  while I’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,  and getting stabbed to death.
The water is flat, flat and calm, it seems a sheet of glass. You look at it, the more you look at it the more you feel like you are looking into your own head

Put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, pick up the bread and devour it.

When he throws the wrench into the air it will catch the light as it spins toward you. Look—it looks like a star.
The bathroom is covered in mint green tile and someone is in there, singing very softly. Is he singing to you? For you?
What does all this love amount to?
The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it.
Like taking the same picture over and over, the spaces in between sealed up—
Both motorbikes are shiny red and both boys have perfect teeth, dark hair, soft hands.
Here is a map with a your name for a capital, here is an arrow to prove a point:
You had not expected this, the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light pummeling you in a stream of fists.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder. One thing. Come closer. Listen...
The booths are plush and the drinks are cheap and in this dim and smoky light you can barely tell whose hands are whose. Someone raises their glass for a toast. Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy?
Here is a brick with blood on it. (Fact) I am speaking from my heart. (Fact)
I don’t think I can take this much longer.
There’s not enough room for us to be ourselves, say the soldiers streaming across the plains, So you will have to be pushed out of the way.
The sun is shining, O how the sun shines down!
How do I tell you how I got here without getting trapped in the past?
Maybe a salad? Spinach, walnuts, blue cheese, apples, and you can't decide between the Extra Large or Jumbo black olives. Which is bigger anyway? Extra Large has a blue label, Jumbo has a purple label. Both cans cost $1.29.
Put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, pick up the bread and devour it.

Two of these Jeffs are windows, and two of these Jeffs are doors, and all of these Jeffs are trying to tell you something.
They all have perfect teeth: white, square, clean, even. And, for some reason, the lighting in the room makes their teeth seem closer than they should be, as if each mouth was a place, a living room with pink carpet and the windows open.
It’s hard to talk about what you believe while you are believing it. Fervor reduces thought to shorthand and all we get is an icon.
I don’t think I can take this much longer.

Here is the hallway and here are the doors and here is the fear of the other thing, the relentless thing, your body drowning in gravity.
Sweetheart, is that you? There are no tears, no pictures of him squarely.
His wounds healed, the skin a bit thicker than before, scars like train tracks on his arms and on his body underneath his shirt.
There is something terribly wrong with his face– empty, restless, one side older than the other.
A thing and a thing and a thing held still— you have to hold something still to find the other things. This is speculation.
Our scope was larger than I realized, which only made me that much more responsible.
Let’s say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men. Here: I’ll be all of them—Jeff and Jeff and Jeff
the hollow boy passed out on the universal bedspread. Here he is again, being sewn up.

what’s there to be faithful to? I am faithful  to you, darling. I say it to the paint.
You were sitting in a bathtub at the hospital and you were crying. You said it hurt. I mean the buildings that were not the hospital. I shouldn’t have mentioned the hospital. I don’t think I can take this much longer.
I will turn myself into a gun, because it’s all I have, because I’m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own.
Our bodies shivering, and the sound of our breathing, and the shore so far away.
To have a thought, there must be an object— the field is empty, sloshed with gold, a hayfield thick with sunshine.
Here are your names and here is the list and here are the things you left behind:
Your name like a song I sing to myself
You saved my life he says, I owe you everything.

Maybe we will wake up to the silence of shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.
The eye stretches to the horizon and then must continue up. Anything past the horizon is invisible, it can only be imagined.
And there, in the distance, not the promised land, but a Holiday Inn, with bougainvillea growing through the chain link by the pool.

The bathroom is covered in mint green tile and someone is in there, singing very softly. Is he singing to you? For you?

My dragonfly, my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart,
The mark on the floor from pushing your chair back, your underwear, one half brick of cheese, the kind I don't like, wrapped up, and poorly, and abandoned on the second shelf next to the poppyseed dressing, which is also yours.

Is it safe? Safe enough. Are you dead as well?
Let’s say you’ve swallowed a bad thing and now it’s got its hands inside you. This is the essence of love and failure.
You’re on your back in your undershirt, a broken man on an ugly bedspread, staring at the water stains on the ceiling.
This is not harmless, the how to touch it, we do not want the screen completely lifted from our eyes, just lifted long enough to see the holes.
My head just sat there. Fair enough.
Our father who art in Heaven. Our father who art buried in the yard. Someone is digging your grave right now.
Here is the cake, and here is the fork, and here's the desire to put it inside us, and then the question behind every question: What happens next?
No more tears. I would like to meet you all in Heaven. But there's a litany of dreams that happens somewhere in the middle. Moonlight spilling on the bathroom floor.
Did he find that one last tender place to sink his teeth in?

Dear Forgiveness, you know that recently  we have had our difficulties and there are many things I want to ask you.
Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all  forgiven, even though we didn’t deserve it.
Nicknames and pet names and baroque French monikers, written in shorthand, written in longhand, scrawled illegibly in brown ink
There was a show on the television about buried treasure. You were trying to convince me that we should buy shovels and go out into the yard
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
It could have been so beautiful—you scout out the road ahead and I will watch your back, how it was and how it will be, memory and fantasy— but each Jeff wants to be the other one.
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart? and you said Kiss me.
No one wants to know what’s in his head. It should be enough.
It's a puzzle: each piece, each room, each time you put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, your ear to the wound that whispers.
Wearing your clothes or standing in the shower for over an hour, pretending that this skin is your skin, these hands your hands, these shins, these soapy flanks.
You swallowing matches and suddenly I’m yelling Strike me. Strike anywhere.

I’m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not  feeding yourself to a bad man  against a black sky prickled with small lights.
Time and more time.
They want to stop but they don’t stop. They cannot get the bullet out. Cut me open and the light streams out. Stitch me up and the light keeps streaming out between the stitches.
We have not been given all the words necessary. We have not been given anything at all. We’ve been driving all night. We’ve been driving a long time. We want to stop. We can’t.

So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog  of non-definitive acts, something other than the desperation.
Maybe we will wake up to the silence of shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.

And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile.
Was I discovered or invented? asks the zero. Feels like I've always been here.

You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds. Look—white fluffy clouds.

You want a better story. Who wouldn’t?  A forest, then.
I will come back from the dead for you.
When we were little we made houses out of cardboard boxes. We can do anything. It's not because our hearts are large, they're not, it's what we struggle with.
and the dark blue over everything, and them holding their breath—
You are in an ordinary suburban bedroom with bunk beds, a bookshelf, two wooden desks and chairs.
Someone to pass this with me. You wanted more. I want what everyone wants.
You keep saying I owe you, I owe... but you say the same thing every time. Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
I’m sure you remember, I was on the phone with you, sweetheart.
I'm in the hallway again, I'm in the hallway. The radio's playing my favorite song. Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.

We have swallowed him up, they said. It's beautiful. It really is.

You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds. Look—white fluffy clouds.
or rain, our bodies wet, clothes clinging arm to elbow, clothes clinging nipple to groin — I’ll be right here. I’m waiting.
Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.  I walk through your dreams and invent the future.
You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened. Your co-workers ask if everything’s okay and you tell them you’re just tired.
The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for.
I put my sadness in a box. The box went soft and wet and weak at the bottom.
Desire driving his hands right into your body.
For a while I thought I was the dragon.  I guess I can tell you that now.
You just wanted to prove there was one safe place, just one safe place where you could love him. You have not found that place yet. You have not made that place yet. You are here. You are here. You're still right here.
Suppose for a moment that the heart has two heads, that the heart has been chained and dunked in a glass booth filled with river water.
You had not expected this, the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light pummeling you in a stream of fists.
Max in the wrong clothes. Max at the party, drunk again. Max in the kitchen, in refrigerator light, his hands around the neck of a beer.
The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you,
Faith in snow, bravery in snow. A daily  maintenance.
He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
What is alive and what isn’t and what should we do about it? Theories: about the nature of the thing.
Here I am leaving you clues.
Is it safe? Safe enough. Are you dead as well?
To have a thought, there must be an object— the field is empty, sloshed with gold, a hayfield thick with sunshine.
I couldn’t make you love me and I’m tired of pulling your teeth.
I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark.
A stone on the path means the tea’s not ready, a stone in the hand means somebody’s angry, the stone inside you still hasn’t hit bottom.
The world doesn’t know what to do with my love. Because it isn’t used to being loved. It’s a framework problem.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you've done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you're tired.
Let’s say you’re still completely in the dark but we love you anyway. We love you. We really do.
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road. Let's call them Jeff.
The one on the left has gone bad in the middle, and the other one on the left is about to. As they wrestle, you can tell that they have forgotten about God, and they are very hungry.
History repeats itself. Somebody says this. History throws its shadow over the beginning, over the desktop, over the sock drawer with its socks, its hidden letters.
Hush, my sweet. These tornadoes are for you.
A map without landmarks is useless. Science dreams its dreams of knowledge—names it, pokes it with equations.
and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces
It was night for many miles and then the real stars in the purple sky, like little boats rowed out too far, begin to disappear.
These, our bodies, possessed by light. Tell me we’ll never get used to it.
The way you slam your body into mine reminds me I'm alive, but monsters are always hungry, darling, and they're only a few steps behind you,
All thoughts finish themselves eventually. I wish it were true. Paint all the men you want but sooner or later they go to ground and rot.
Someone to pass this with me. You wanted more. I want what everyone wants.
There is no way to make this story interesting. A pause, a road, the taste of grave in the mouth. The rocks dig into my skin like arrowheads.
They want to stop but they don’t stop. They cannot get the bullet out. Cut me open and the light streams out. Stitch me up and the light keeps streaming out between the stitches.
This is the in-between, the waiting that happens in the space between one note and the next, the place where you confuse his hands with the room,
Consider the hairpin turn. It is waiting for you like a red door or the broken leg of a dog.
I turned away from darkness to see daylight, to see what would happen. What happened? What does a man want?
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and you're trying not to tell him that you love him,
The view from above— untethered scrutiny. It helps to have an anchor but your head is going somewhere anyway.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder.
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home. I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark. Sweetheart, is that you?
Boots continue to fall to the floor in the apartment above you.
You wanted to be in love and he happened to get in the way.
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party and seduced you  and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing.
It’s thinking of love. It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do, because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven, which brings us back to the hero's shoulders and the gentleness that comes, not from the absence of violence, but despite the abundance of it.
He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
When you bang on the wall you have to remember you’re on both sides of it already but go ahead, yell at yourself.
Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.
You see it as a room, a tabernacle, the dark hotel. You're in the hallway again, and you open the door, and if you're ready you'll see it, but maybe one part of your mind decides that the other parts aren't ready,
your hands a river gesture, the birds in flight, the birds still singing outside the greasy window, in the trees.
What does all this love amount to?
The mind moves forward, the paint layers up: glop glop and shellac. I shovel the color into our faces, I shovel our faces into our faces.
but here we are in the weeds again, here we are in the bowels of the thing: your world doesn’t make sense.
Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
I wanted to be thrown over, possessed.
I mean, maybe it’s better if my opponent wins.
Imagine a room, a sudden glow.
I take off my hands and I give them to you but you don’t want them, so I take them back and put them on the wrong way, the wrong wrists.
Faith in snow, bravery in snow… / We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
Everyone needs a place. You need it for the moment you need it, then you bless it— and move on. Who does this? No one.
Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall. The dawn was breaking the bones of your heart like twigs. You had not expected this, the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light pummeling you in a stream of fists.
It’s hard to talk about what you believe while you are believing it. Fervor reduces thought to shorthand and all we get is an icon.
And there's snow on the TV, a landscape full of snow, falling from the fire-colored sky.  But thanks, thanks for calling it the blue sky
It’s not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere, it’s more like a song on a policeman’s radio,
you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do, because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.
What would you like? I’d like my money’s worth.
The surface of the water was still and bright. Your feet were burning so I put my hands on them, but my hands were burning too.
how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days were bright red,
headlights shining in all directions, night spilling over them like gasoline in all directions,
Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this— swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
Your broken ribs, the back of your head, your hand to mouth or hand to now, right now, like you mean it, like it's splitting you in two. Now look at the lights, the lights.
Some say God is where we put our sorrow. God says, Which one of you fuckers can get to me first?
Names of heat and names of light, names of collision in the dark, on the side of the bus, in the bark of the tree, in ballpoint pen on jeans and hands and the backs of matchbooks that then get lost.
I looked at all the trees and didn’t know what to do.
I’m sure you remember, I was on the phone with you, sweetheart.
Hold onto your voice. Hold onto your breath. Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.
The yard is dark, the tomatoes are next to the whitewashed wall, the book on the table is about Spain, the windows are painted shut.
I’m not the princess either.  Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
Let me do it right for once,  for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,  you know the story, simply heaven.
I burst into tears and flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed canopied with devastated clouds.
It's a fairy tale, the story underneath the story, sliding down the polished halls, lightning here and gone.
It starts with bloodshed, always bloodshed, always the same running from something larger than yourself story,
Yes. He would look out the window and stare at the trees that once had too many branches and now seemed to have too few. Is that all?
See, we’ve won again, here we are at the place where I get to beg for it where I get to say Please, for just one night, will you lay down next to me, we can leave our clothes on, we can stay all buttoned up? But we both know how it goes––
he isn’t looking at a bird, real bird, as he paints, he is looking at his heart, which is impossible.
Your body told me in a dream it’s never been afraid of anything.
This is my hand over his face, which isn’t his face anymore, revising.
He’s easy to desire since there’s not much to him, vague and smeary in his ochers, in his umbers, burning in the open field.
We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.
The moon, of course, is always there—day moon, but it’s still there; behind the clouds but it’s still there.
and then you don't remember where you've been, and you find yourself down the hall again, the lights gone dim as the left hand sings the right hand back to sleep.
You said Don’t be silly, so I followed you into the store. We were thumping the melons when I heard somebody say Nobody move!
He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand.
Black cherries in chocolate, the ring around the moon, a beetle underneath a glass—you cannot make out all the words, but you're sure he knows you're in there, and he's singing to you, even though you don't know who he is.
how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces.
You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened. Your co-workers ask if everything’s okay and you tell them you’re just tired. And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile.
We still groped for each other on the backstairs or in parked cars as the roads around us grew glossy with ice and our breath softened the view through a glass already laced with frost,
The one on the left has gone bad in the middle, and the other one on the left is about to. As they wrestle, you can tell that they have forgotten about God, and they are very hungry.
I make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you’re really there.
We’ve made a graveyard out of the bone white afternoon.
We’re filming the movie called Planet of Love- there’s sex of course, and ballroom dancing, fancy clothes and waterlilies in the pond,
It’s good to give explicit answers, showing all the steps, necessary and sufficient.
Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating.
We clutch our bellies and roll on the floor... When I say this, it should mean laughter,  not poison.
but tell me you love this, tell me you’re not miserable.
I took a shower and tried to catch my breath. You were lying on top of the bedspread in boxer shorts, watching cartoons and laughing but not making any sound.
because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.
The enormity of my desire disgusts me.
This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you.
I am only repeating what I heard. This is one love. There are many loves but only one war.
He puts his hands all over you to keep you in the room. It’s night. It’s noon. He’s driving. It’s happening all over again.
I clawed my way into the light but the light is just as scary. I’d rather quit. I’d rather be sad. It’s too much work.
Digging out the bullet and holding it up to the light, the light. Digging out the bullet and holding it up to the light.
After everything that was going to happen has happened you ask only for the cab fare home and realize you should have asked for more because he couldn't care less, either way.
I took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I’d just as soon kill you myself, I say.
Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.
Sure, I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow  glass, but that comes later.
The water is flat, flat and calm, it seems a sheet of glass. You look at it, the more you look at it the more you feel like you are looking into your own head
I turned my back on the story. A sense of superiority. Everything casts a shadow.
Let’s admit, without apology, what we do to each other. We know who our enemies are. We know.
All this was prepared for me. All this was set in motion long ago. I live in someone else's future.
You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that, and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me you love this, tell me you're not miserable.
Leave out the equal sign and the very idea of place will end,
He’s easy to desire since there’s not much to him, vague and smeary in his ochers, in his umbers, burning in the open field.
Here he is again, being sewn up.
History throws its shadow over the beginning, over the desktop, over the sock drawer with its socks, its hidden letters.
I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark, hunched over on the wooden chair in the kitchen, listening to the rain.
Do we simply stare at what's horrible and forgive it?
My shadow falls across him and it doesn’t go away.
I have my body and you have yours. Believe it if you can. Negative space is silly.
Never finish a war without  starting another. I’ve seen your  true face: the back of your head.  If you were walking away, keep walking.
He likes the feel of the coffeepot. More than the hacksaw? Yes, and he likes flipping the chairs, watching them fill with people.
I stood in the road looking forward and back, to see if it would change something. After a while, I went back inside and tripped over the box.
Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. These, our bodies, possessed by light. Tell me we’ll never get used to it.
The night sky is vast and wide.
A man says to another man, There is something I have to tell you. No, says the other man. No, you don't.
You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and you’re trying not to tell him that you love him, and you’re trying to choke down the feeling, and you’re trembling,
Someone has to leave first. This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
Do we want to remind you of something? Yes: the world is good and we belong here.
Two brothers are fighting by the side of the road. Two motorbikes have fallen over on the shoulder, leaking oil into the dirt, while the interlocking brothers grapple and swing.
Everyone needs a place. It shouldn’t be inside of someone else.
The sun shines down. It's a beautiful day. Consider the hairpin turn. Do not choose sides yet.
and the dark blue over everything, and them holding their breath—
The best part of spirituality is reverence. There are other parts.
Do you know how it ends? Do you feel lucky? Do you want to go home now?
Sure, it’s good to feel things, and if it hurts, we’re doing it to ourselves, or so the saying goes, but there should be a different music here.
Let’s kill something. Land a man in a landscape and he’ll try to conquer it. Make him handsome and you’re a fascist, make him ugly and you’re saying nothing new.
Consider the hairpin turn.
It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
I swear, I end up feeling empty, like you’ve taken something out of me, and I have to search my body for the scars, thinking Did he find that one last tender place to sink his teeth in?
Someone has to leave first. This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
He wants to be tender and merciful. That sounds overly valorous. Sounds like penance.
The heart is monologing about hesitation and fulfillment while behind the red brocade the heart is drowning. Can the heart escape? Does love even care? Snow falls as we dump the booth in the bay.
The mark on the floor from pushing your chair back, your underwear, one half brick of cheese, the kind I don't like, wrapped up, and poorly, and abandoned on the second shelf next to the poppyseed dressing, which is also yours.
the slap of waves on the hull of a boat that’s sinking to the sound of mermaids singing songs of love,
we laugh and it pits the world against us,
This is a story of loops, at least one. I stepped off the loop.
Close your eyes. A lover is standing too close to focus on. Leave me blurry and fall toward me with your entire body.
The water is flat, flat and calm, it seems a sheet of glass. You look at it, the more you look at it the more you feel like you are looking into your own head
Forget the dragon,  leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.
Drink it, the bartender says. It's yours, you deserve it. It's already been paid for. Somebody's paid for it already. There's no mistake, he says. It's your drink, the one you asked for, just the way you like it.
The attempt to say Come over. Bring your friends. It's a potluck, I'm making pork chops, I'm making those long noodles you love so much.
Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember.
The yard is dark, the tomatoes are next to the whitewashed wall, the book on the table is about Spain, the windows are painted shut.
It could have been so beautiful—you scout out the road ahead and I will watch your back, how it was and how it will be, memory and fantasy— but each Jeff wants to be the other one.
He puts his hands all over you to keep you in the room. It’s night. It’s noon. He’s driving. It’s happening all over again.
Why build a room you can live in? Why build a shed for your fears? The life of the body is a nightmare.
At home: the moon delivered.
he keeps saying I owe you, says Your shoes are filling with your own damn blood, you must want something, just tell me, and it’s yours.
Is it safe? Safe enough. Are you dead as well?
A map without landmarks is useless. Science dreams its dreams of knowledge—names it, pokes it with equations.
He was dead anyway, a ghost. I'm surprised I saw his hand at all.
You asked me once, What are we made of? Well, these are the things we’re made of.
Will you defend yourself?  From me, I mean. Let’s kill something.
You raised your hand to your face as if to hide it, the pink fingers gone gold as the light streamed straight to the bone, as if you were the small room closed in glass with every speck of dust illuminated.
Something dead that doesn't know it's dead.  A painting, for instance. An abstraction.
All thoughts finish themselves eventually. I wish it were true. Paint all the men you want but sooner or later they go to ground and rot.
The heart is monologing about hesitation and fulfillment while behind the red brocade the heart is drowning. Can the heart escape? Does love even care? Snow falls as we dump the booth in the bay.
Hello darling, sorry about that.
Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.
Here he is again, being sewn up.
The boy sleeps on the roof or falls out of trees.
Why build a room you can live in? Why build a shed for your fears? The life of the body is a nightmare.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him—
You had not expected this, the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light pummeling you in a stream of fists.
I stayed as long as I could, he said. Now look at the moon.
Says to himself The boy's no good. The boy is just no good. but he takes you in his arms and pushes your flesh around to see if you could ever be ugly to him.
Red. And a little more red.
Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. These, our bodies, possessed by light.
What do you do with a man like that? While you are deciding, more men ride in.
The wife had died of sadness, by her own hand. The father walks out of the room and the room is almost empty.
We have come back from Jerusalem where we found not  what we sought, so do it over, give me another version,  a different room, another hallway, the kitchen painted over  and over,
We do not walk through a passive landscape. The paint dries eventually. The bodies decompose eventually.
This is where he trots out his sadness. Little black cloud, little black umbrella.
he is trying to kill you, and you deserve it, you do, and you know this, and you are ready to die in this swimming pool
I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything, without having to say that I ran out into the street to prove something, that he didn’t love me,
Every story has its chapter in the desert, the long slide from kingdom to kingdom through the wilderness, where you learn things, where you're left to your own devices.
And then the sense of being smothered underneath a sack of lentils or potatoes, or of a boat at night slamming into the dock again without navigation, without consideration,
The moon, of course, is always there—
Inside your head you hear a phone ringing  and when you open your eyes  only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.
You want a better story. Who wouldn’t?
your name with two X’s to mark the spots, to hold the place, to keep the treasure from becoming ever lost.
I think I’d rather keep the bullet. It’s mine, see, I’m not giving it up. This way you still owe me, and that’s as good as anything.
This is the part where you wake up in your clothes again, this is the part where you’re trying to stay inside the building. Stay in the room for now, he says. Stay in the room for now.
I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home.
how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces.
I kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.
I paint in his face and I paint it out again. There is a question I am afraid to ask: to supply the world with what?
You keep saying I owe you, I owe... but you say the same thing every time. Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
I will turn myself into a gun, because it’s all I have, because I’m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own.
And you can hear the man in the apartment above you taking off his shoes. You hear the first boot hit the floor and you’re looking up, you’re waiting
But we both know how it goes––I say I want you inside me and you hold my head underwater, I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
Ask for a blessing? You can try, but we will not remain unscathed. Flex your will or abandon your will and let the world have its way with you
Put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, pick up the bread and devour it.
Forget about his insides, his plumbing and his furnaces, put a thing in his hand and be done with it.
The eye stretches to the horizon and then must continue up. Anything past the horizon is invisible, it can only be imagined.
The dead will make room for me.
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
There’s smashed glass glittering everywhere like stars.
and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and you're trying not to tell him that you love him,
You're dancing: you're neck and neck or cheek to cheek, he's there or he isn't, the open road. Imagine a room. Imagine you're dancing. Imagine the room now falling away. Don't move.
Left hand raising the fork to the mouth, feeling the meat slide down your throat, thinking My throat. Mine. Everything in this cone of light is mine.
This is not harmless, the how to touch it, we do not want the screen completely lifted from our eyes, just lifted long enough to see the holes.
You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you.
Looking back is easy for a while and then looking back gets murky. There is the road, and there is the story of where the road goes, and then more road,
Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I’m getting at?
Close your eyes. A lover is standing too close to focus on. Leave me blurry and fall toward me with your entire body.
Close your eyes. A lover is standing too close to focus on. Leave me blurry and fall toward me with your entire body.
You miss the point: the face in the mirror is a little traitor, the face in the mirror is a pale and naked hostage and no one can tell which room he’s being held in.
We are all going forward. None of us are going back.
We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart? and you said Kiss me.
Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall.
It makes me tired, Henry. Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I’m getting at?
Will you defend yourself?  From me, I mean. Let’s kill something.
Let’s say you’re driving down the road with your eyes closed but my eyes are also closed. You’re by the side of the road.
And then it's gone. Makes you sad. All your friends are gone. Goodbye Goodbye.
Like sandpaper, the light, or a blessing, or a bruise. Blood everywhere, he said, the red light hemorrhaging from everywhere at once.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk. Not because I don’t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I’m always saving and you’re always owing and I’m tired of asking to settle the debt.
The smear of his head—I paint it out, I paint it in again. I ask it what it wants. I want to be a cornerstone, says the head.
You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together  to make a creature that will do what I say or love me back.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him—
For a while I thought I was the dragon.  I guess I can tell you that now.
You killed my wife and you can't even keep a glass on the table.
The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you,
Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.
You have a cold cold smile. You were burned, you were about to burn, you’re still on fire.
Your mother is pretending that she hasn't seen anything. Your father is fiddling with the knobs of the radio. There is an empty space next to you in the backseat of the station wagon. Make it the shape of everything you need. Now say hello.
I said kiss me here and here and here And you did.
The stranger says there are no more couches and he will have to sleep in your bed. You try to warn him, you tell him you will want to get inside him, and ruin him, but he doesn't listen.
I couldn’t get the boy to kill me, but I wore his jacket for the longest time.
You thought if you handed over your body he’d do something interesting.
I never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way, and I don’t want to be the kind that says the wrong way. But it doesn’t work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats.
We’re shouting the scene where I swallow your heart and you make me spit it up again.
Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?  Let me do it right for once,
I like dead things, says the landscape. They cannot hurt me. The armies swarm the cities of the yellow field and burn them down.
You are my moon, Little Moon, and it's late enough. So climb down out of the tree.
The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you, and you deserve it, you do, and you know this, and you are ready to die in this swimming pool because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means your life is over anyway.
I told you so. Yes, you did, dear.
Lie under the covers, pretending to sleep, while I'm in the other room. Imagine my legs crossed, my hair combed, the shine of my boots in the slatted light.
Ask for a blessing? You can try, but we will not remain unscathed. Flex your will or abandon your will and let the world have its way with you
Every morning the maple leaves.
The hand sings weapon. The mind says tool. The body swerves in the service of the mind, which is evidence of the mind but not actual proof.
Eventually the birds must land.
The man on top of you is teaching you how to hate, sees you as a piece of real estate, just another fallow field lying underneath him like a sacrifice.
You take her out into the rain and you fall in love with her and she leaves you and you’re desolate.
I mean the buildings that were not the hospital. I shouldn’t have mentioned the hospital.
Four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, fall down right there. I wanted to fall down right there but I knew you wouldn’t catch me because you’re dead.
all these ghosts come streaming down and sometimes I wish I had something else.
You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened. Your co-workers ask if everything’s okay and you tell them you’re just tired.
If you love me, you don't love me in a way that I understand.
If you love me, you don't love me in a way that I understand.
You do the math, you expect the trouble. The seaside town. The electric fence.
You do the math, you expect the trouble. The seaside town. The electric fence.
Don’t you see, it’s like I’ve swallowed your house keys, and it feels so natural, like the bullet was already there, like it’s been waiting inside me the whole time.

We have been very brave, we have wanted to know the worst, wanted the curtain to be lifted from our eyes.
None of it is real, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up singing.
When you bang on the wall you have to remember you’re on both sides of it already but go ahead, yell at yourself.
There is nothing interesting about the sea.
And he hasn’t moved, he’s frozen, and you’ve kissed him, and he’ll never forgive you, and maybe now he’ll never leave you alone.
All night I stretched my arms across him, rivers of blood, the dark woods, singing with all my skin and bone
I'm the director and I'm screaming at you, I'm waving my arms in the sky, and everyone's watching, everyone's curious, everyone's holding their breath.
I’m bleeding, I’m not just making conversation.
Here is my hand, my heart, my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated cities at the center of me, and here is the center of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we can drink from, but I can’t go through with it.
This is my hand over his face, which isn’t his face anymore, revising.
shut up  I’m getting to it.
You are feeling things he’s no longer in touch with.
While you're deciding, the afternoon light is streaming through the windows behind the bank of checkout counters. Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder.
Okay, if you’re so great, you do it—  here’s the pencil, make it work...
I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything, without having to say that I ran out into the street to prove something, that he didn’t love me,
Now we're getting somewhere.
Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I’m getting at?
You were very beautiful.
He raises the moon on a crane for effect, cue the violins.  That’s what the violins are for.
Together we trace out a trail away from doom. There isn't hope, there is a trail. I follow you.
They're hurling their bodies down the freeway to the smell of gasoline, which is the sound of a voice saying I told you so.
Keep your paints wet. Trust me, I have things to say.
Your broken ribs, the back of your head, your hand to mouth or hand to now, right now, like you mean it, like it's splitting you in two. Now look at the lights, the lights.
The smell of him mixed with creosote, exhaust— There, on the ground, slipping through the minutes, trying to notch them.
I stayed as long as I could, he said. Now look at the moon.
There's a part in the movie where you can see right through the acting, where you can tell that I'm about to burst into tears, right before I burst into tears and flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed canopied with devastated clouds.
headlights shining in all directions, night spilling over them like gasoline in all directions,
Look, Jeff, I'm telling you, for the last time, I mean it, etcetera. They are the same and they are not the same. They are the same and they hate each other for it.
Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake and dress them in warm clothes again. How it was late, and no one could sleep,
They want you to love the whole damn world but you won't, you want it all narrowed down to one fleshy man in the bath, who knows what to do with his body, with his hands.
Your math is crazy, says the moon.
Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy?
We’re shouting the scene where I swallow your heart and you make me spit it up again.
A thought bigger than your own head. Try it. Seriously. Cover more ground.
When we were little we made houses out of cardboard boxes. We can do anything. It's not because our hearts are large, they're not, it's what we struggle with.
You were drinking sangria and I was throwing oranges at you, but it didn’t matter.
The boy is a bird, a bad bird. He falls out of trees.
Jeff or Jeff? Who do you want to be? You just wanted to play in your own backyard, but you don't know where your own yard is, exactly.
The one in front will want to take you apart, and slowly. His deft and stubby fingers searching every shank and lock for weaknesses. You could love this boy with all your heart.
I am the fire, says the fire. My body is a graveyard,
You wanted to think of yourself as someone who did these kinds of things. You wanted to be in love and he happened to get in the way.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
Two brothers are fighting by the side of the road. Two motorbikes have fallen over on the shoulder, leaking oil into the dirt, while the interlocking brothers grapple and swing.
You are playing cards with three men named Jeff. Two of the Jeffs seem somewhat familiar, but the Jeff across from you keeps staring at your hands, your mouth, and you're certain that you've never seen this Jeff before
You see them through the backseat window as you and your parents drive past. You are twelve years old. You do not have a brother. You have never experienced anything this ferocious or intentional with another person.
Let’s say you’re still completely in the dark but we love you anyway. We love you. We really do.
It should be enough. To make something beautiful should be enough. It isn’t. It should be.
We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven,
Here's the champagne on the floor, and here are your house keys, and here are the curtains that your cat peed on. And here is your cat, who keeps eating grass and vomiting in the hallway.
You're in the hallway again. The radio is playing your favorite song. You're in the hallway. Open the door again. Open the door.
So now we have come to a great battlefield, the warmth of the fire, the fire still burning, the heat escaping like a broken promise.
At home: the moon delivered.
I cut off my head and threw it in the sky. It turned into birds. I called it thinking.
This has nothing to do with faith but is still a good question.
O how he loves you, darling boy. O how, like always, he invents the monsters underneath the bed to get you to sleep next to him, chest to chest or chest to back, the covers drawn around you in an act of faith against the night.
In these dreams it’s always you: the boy in the sweatshirt, the boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me from jumping off the bridge.
And because the first Jeff is in front we'll consider him the older, and therefore responsible for lending money and the occasional punch in the shoulder.
I looked at all the trees and didn’t know what to do.
Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
The best part of spirituality is reverence. There are other parts.
Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly  flames everywhere.
Smeared night, smudged dawn. I saw him fall. Them, falling. Split and felled and pounded into the ground.
but tell me you love this, tell me you’re not miserable.
But you are my nomad and I love you sideways daily.
he isn’t looking at a bird, real bird, as he paints, he is looking at his heart, which is impossible.
Henry with a needle and thread, hovering over the hollow boy passed out on the universal bedspread.
Here I am leaving you clues.
He is looking at the wall and I am looking at his looking. Difficult thing, to be scrutinized so long.
If you have one apples and I take away one apples you have, zero apples and a sadness, says the sadness.
Yellow, yellow, gold, and ocher. We stopped. We held the field. We stood very still.
It spins like a wheel inside you: green yellow, green blue, green beautiful green. It's simple: it isn't over, it's just begun. It's green. It's still green.
It spins like a wheel inside you: green yellow, green blue, green beautiful green. It's simple: it isn't over, it's just begun. It's green. It's still green.
For a while I thought I was the dragon.  I guess I can tell you that now.
There’s only one thing I want, don’t make me say it, just get me bandages, I’m bleeding, I’m not just making conversation.
Something dead that doesn't know it's dead.  A painting, for instance. An abstraction.
A thing and a thing and a thing held still— you have to hold something still to find the other things. This is speculation.
Your mother is pretending that she hasn't seen anything. Your father is fiddling with the knobs of the radio. There is an empty space next to you in the backseat of the station wagon. Make it the shape of everything you need. Now say hello.
Take it or leave it, and for the most part you take it. Not just the idea of it but the ramifications of it.
your breath on my neck like a music that holds my hands down, kisses as they burn their way along my spine —
A man with a bandage is in the middle of something. Everyone understands this. Everyone wants a battlefield.
The smell of him mixed with creosote, exhaust— There, on the ground, slipping through the minutes, trying to notch them.
I couldn’t get the boy to kill me, but I wore his jacket for the longest time.
This is where he trots out his sadness. Little black cloud, little black umbrella.
We carve up the world and crown it with numbers—lumens, ounces, decibels.
There should be a place. At the rest stop, in the restaurant, the overpass, the water’s edge...
You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar.
The wife has a dead hand. This is earlier. She is living and her dead hand feeds her pills that don't work.
We've read the back of the book, we know what's going to happen. The fields burned, the land destroyed, the lovers left broken in the brown dirt. And then it's gone. Makes you sad. All your friends are gone. Goodbye Goodbye.
I am still talking to you about help. I still do not have  these luxuries. I have told you where I’m coming from, so put it together.
You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.
Lying on the sofa with my eyes closed, I didn’t want to see it this way, everything eating everything in the end.
See, we’ve won again, here we are at the place where I get to beg for it where I get to say Please, for just one night, will you lay down next to me, we can leave our clothes on, we can stay all buttoned up? But we both know how it goes––
You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and you’re trying not to tell him that you love him, and you’re trying to choke down the feeling, and you’re trembling,
There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which Jeff you are.
All night I stretched my arms across him, rivers of blood
It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
A man walks into a bar and says: Take my wife–please. So you do.
Please keep him safe. Let him lay his head on my chest and we will be like sailors, swimming in the sound of it, dashed to pieces.
He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand.
We have been very brave, we have wanted to know the worst, wanted the curtain to be lifted from our eyes.
Take it or leave it, and for the most part you take it. Not just the idea of it but the ramifications of it.
Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.
We have swallowed him up, they said. It's beautiful. It really is.
The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for.
headlights shining in all directions, night spilling over them like gasoline in all directions,
You had not expected this, the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light pummeling you in a stream of fists.
Someone has to leave first. This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.
History is a little man in a brown suit trying to define a room he is outside of.
Why build a room you can live in? Why build a shed for your fears? The life of the body is a nightmare.
Your name is Jeff and somewhere up ahead of you your brother has pulled to the side of the road and he is waiting for you with a lug wrench clutched in his greasy fist.
The birds were watching you.
Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.
None of it is real, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up singing.
I want to tell you this story without having to be in it:
But you are my nomad and I love you sideways daily. Sideways because I have to beam my love in all directions, hoping it bounces off something and eventually finds you.
Your body told me in a dream it’s never been afraid of anything.
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party and seduced you  and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing.
I thought I heard the clink of ice to teeth. I thought I heard the clink of teeth to glass.
I am the wind and the wind is invisible, all the leaves tremble but I am invisible,
Names called out across the water, names I called you behind your back, sour and delicious, secret and unrepeatable,
That’s a nice touch, stains in the night, whiskey and kisses for everyone.
You said Will you love me even more when I'm dead? And I said No, and I threw the pills on the sand.
Cut off your head, kid. For all the good it'll do ya. I glued my head back on.
And then the second boot falls. And then a third, a fourth, a fifth.
My shadow falls across him and it doesn’t go away.
Names like pain cries, names like tombstones, names forgotten and reinvented, names forbidden or overused.
Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours.
Imagine this: You’re pulling the car over. Somebody’s waiting.
It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
Lying on the sofa with my eyes closed, I didn’t want to see it this way, everything eating everything in the end.
A thing and a thing and a thing held still— you have to hold something still to find the other things. This is speculation.
This time everyone has the best intentions. You have cancer. Let's say you have cancer. Let's say you've swallowed a bad thing and now it's got its hands inside you. This is the essence of love and failure.
Someone is digging your grave right now. Someone is drawing a bath to wash you clean, he said, so think of the wind, so happy, so warm.
So what’s left? Sing a song about the room we’re in? Hammer in the pegs that fix the meaning to the landscape?
When he throws the wrench into the air it will catch the light as it spins toward you. Look—it looks like a star.
I’m the director. I’m in a helicopter. I have a megaphone and you play along, because you want to die for love, you always have.
My mother married a man who divorced her for money. Phyllis, he would say, If you don’t stop buying jewelry, I will have to divorce you to keep us out of the poorhouse. When he said this, she would stub out a cigarette, mutter something under her breath.
what’s there to be faithful to? I am faithful  to you, darling. I say it to the paint.
When we were little we made houses out of cardboard boxes. We can do anything. It's not because our hearts are large, they're not, it's what we struggle with.
We knocked the heads off the statuary, deprived the landmarks of any meaning. Victory swelling in the occupation. History is painted by the winners.
I’ve seen your true face: the back of your head.
You were burned, you were about to burn, you’re still on fire.
Together we trace out a trail away from doom. There isn't hope, there is a trail. I follow you.
Here he is again, being sewn up.
Your jeep. Your teeth. The coffee that you bought me. The sandwich cut in half on the plate.
sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud. Especially that, but I should have known.
There should be a place. At the rest stop, in the restaurant, the overpass, the water’s edge...
or will I say Roll over and let me fuck you till you puke, Henry, you owe me this much, you can indulge me this at least, can’t you?
you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do, because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.
I wanted to be wanted and he was very beautiful, kissed with his eyes closed, and only felt good while moving.
Down the alley, around the arcade,  up the stairs of the building  to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things,
Nicknames and pet names and baroque French monikers, written in shorthand, written in longhand, scrawled illegibly in brown ink
You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things. You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do long division, and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do,
Someone once told me that explaining is an admission of failure.
You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things. You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do long division, and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy,
If you love me, you don't love me in a way that I understand.
The life of the mind is a disappointment, but remember what stands for what.
So the doctor says you need more stitches and the bruise cream isn't working. So much for the facts. Let's say you're still completely in the dark but we love you anyway. We love you. We really do.
Their names remain on the deed to the house. It isn’t haunted, it’s owned by ghosts. When I die, I will come in fast and low. I will stick the landing. There will be no confusion. The dead will make room for me.
You were burned, you were about to burn, you’re still on fire.
In a word, in a phrase, it’s a movie, you’re the star. so smile for the camera, it’s your big scene, you know your lines.
To them he is a mirror, but to you he is a room.
Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts  from one foot to the other.
Down the alley, around the arcade,  up the stairs of the building  to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things,
In the airport bathroom’s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of  unnatural light, my hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away.
He is looking at the wall and I am looking at his looking. Difficult thing, to be scrutinized so long.
Brother, dead brother, who speaks to him in dreams. These are a few things worth saying.
If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder.
It reminds me of some tale, stay with me to remember, it reminds me of where I was going without you.
Hush, my sweet. These tornadoes are for you.
Someone once told me that explaining is an admission of failure.
You said I could have anything I wanted, but I  just couldn’t say it out loud.
You can’t paint the inside of anything, so why would you try? Painting the inside of anything is dangerous.
What is he going to do with these sandwiches? They're already made, but he doesn't want to eat them.
I put my sadness in a box. The box went soft and wet and weak at the bottom.
The smell of him mixed with creosote, exhaust— There, on the ground, slipping through the minutes, trying to notch them.
what’s there to be faithful to? I am faithful  to you, darling. I say it to the paint.
Here and there and what to do about it.
I say the phrases that keep it all going, and everybody plays along.
I’m a romantic, an absurdist. I am bad with facts and I get confused. I’m a hostile witness. I didn’t want to see this, talk about this. I wanted to testify to something else.
The surface of the water was still and bright. Your feet were burning so I put my hands on them, but my hands were burning too.
We are all just trying to be holy.
Something is not right about what I’m doing but I’m still doing it—living in the worst parts, ruining myself.
Want something to chase you? Run.
I imagined my wrists broken just enough to keep the feeling from crawling up my arm.
I borrowed your shoes and didn’t put them away. You were crying and eating rice.
You are here. You are here. You're still right here.
They swarm the field and their painted flags unfurl. Crown yourself with leaves and stake your claim before something smears up the paint.
Two brothers are fighting by the side of the road. Two motorbikes have fallen over on the shoulder, leaking oil into the dirt, while the interlocking brothers grapple and swing.
So what’s left? Sing a song about the room we’re in? Hammer in the pegs that fix the meaning to the landscape?
We’ve made a graveyard out of the bone white afternoon.
There are two twins on motorbikes but they are not on motorbikes, they're in a garden where the flowers are as big as thumbs.
I want to tell you this story without having to be in it:
I watched TV. I had a Coke at the bar. I had four Cokes, four dreams in a row.
They weren’t animals but they looked like animals, enough like animals to make it confusing, meant something but the meaning was slippery:
Wearing your clothes or standing in the shower for over an hour, pretending that this skin is your skin, these hands your hands, these shins, these soapy flanks.
To them he is a mirror, but to you he is a room.
Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall. The dawn was breaking the bones of your heart like twigs. You had not expected this, the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light pummeling you in a stream of fists.
He had green eyes, so I wanted to sleep with him— green eyes flecked with yellow, dried leaves on the surface of a pool—
We are all just trying to be holy.
Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.
A forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.  Love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.
Still wet, I lay down next to you. Your arms, your legs, your naked chest, your ribs delineated like a junkyard dogs.
I kissed my mouth, it was no longer a mouth. I threw a spear at my head, I didn’t have a head.
I’m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not  feeding yourself to a bad man  against a black sky prickled with small lights.
Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?  Let me do it right for once,
Let's say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men.
And the part where I push you  flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,  shut up, I’m getting to it.
You, the now familiar whipping boy, but you’re beautiful, he can feel the dogs licking his heart.
No one  will ever want to sleep with you.
But damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills.
I looked out the window and said This doesn’t look that much different from home, because it didn’t, but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.
You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar.
Let’s say you’ve swallowed a bad thing and now it’s got its hands inside you. This is the essence of love and failure.
Even when you’re standing up you look like you’re lying down, but will you let me kiss your neck, baby? Do I have to tie your arms down?
The entire history of human desire takes about seventy minutes to tell.
Theories: about the nature of the thing. And of the soul. Because people die. The fear: that nothing survives. The greater fear: that something does.
You said Tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...
You see it as a room, a tabernacle, the dark hotel. You're in the hallway again, and you open the door, and if you're ready you'll see it, but maybe one part of your mind decides that the other parts aren't ready,
I couldn’t make you love me and I’m tired of pulling your teeth.
Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.
Even when I look away I am still looking. He is inside his body and I am inside my body and it matters less and less.
The voice wants to be a hand and the hand wants to do something useful. What did you really want?
You cannot get in the way of anyone's path to God.
We used to dream about them. We used to do a lot of things.
I had a dream where you said that. Thanks for saying that. You weren’t supposed to.
Every morning the maple leaves.
So now we have come to a great battlefield, the warmth of the fire, the fire still burning, the heat escaping like a broken promise.
I’d rather quit. I’d rather be sad. It’s too much work. Admirable? Not really.
I had to make up all the words myself. The way they taste, the way they sound in the air.
I’m sorry it’s such a lousy story.
I cut off my head and threw it in the sky. It turned into birds. I called it thinking.
I tried that one time, high school, second lunch, and then again,  years later, in the chlorinated pool.
He's turning your back into a table so he doesn't have to eat off the floor, so he can get comfortable, pressing against you until he fits, until he's made a place for himself inside you.
and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like you've discovered something you don't even have a name for.
Then you wanted pasta, so we trampled out into the tomatoes and rolled around to make the sauce.
Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
all I can do is stand on the curb and say Sorry about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.
He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
Let me do it right for once,  for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,  you know the story, simply heaven.
You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened. Your co-workers ask if everything’s okay and you tell them you’re just tired.
Build me a city and call it Jerusalem. Build me another and call it  Jerusalem.
Your name like a song I sing to myself
Your skin looked blue in the television light. Your teeth looked yellow.
Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts  from one foot to the other.
A man takes his sadness down to the river and throws it in the river but then he’s still left with the river. A man takes his sadness and throws it away but then he’s still left with his hands.
You can’t paint the inside of anything, so why would you try? Painting the inside of anything is dangerous.
I'm in the hallway again, I'm in the hallway. The radio's playing my favorite song. Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.
or will I say Roll over and let me fuck you till you puke, Henry, you owe me this much, you can indulge me this at least, can’t you?
Can you see them pressed into the gravel, pressed into the dirt, pressing against each other in an effort to make the minutes stop—
Both motorbikes are shiny red and both boys have perfect teeth, dark hair, soft hands.
It’s time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?
It's getting late, Little Moon. Finish the song. It's not that late.
Your name is Jeff and somewhere up ahead of you your brother has pulled to the side of the road and he is waiting for you with a lug wrench clutched in his greasy fist.
… the hunter’s heart, the hunter’s mouth, the trees and the trees and the space between the trees, swimming in gold.
To them he is a mirror, but to you he is a room.
Hello darling, sorry about that.
At first there were too many branches so he cut them and then it was winter. He meaning you.
You said Don’t be silly, so I followed you into the store. We were thumping the melons when I heard somebody say Nobody move!
And then the sense of being smothered underneath a sack of lentils or potatoes, or of a boat at night slamming into the dock again without navigation, without consideration,
Names of endurance, names of devotion, street names and place names and all the names of our dark heaven crackling in their pan.
Makes a cathedral, him pressing against me, his lips at my neck, and yes, I do believe his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me like stars.
This boy, half-destroyed, screaming Drive into that tree, drive off the embankment.
he isn’t looking at a bird, real bird, as he paints, he is looking at his heart, which is impossible.
You wanted to be in love and he happened to get in the way.
I watched TV. I had a Coke at the bar. I had four Cokes, four dreams in a row.
The attempt to say Come over. Bring your friends. It's a potluck, I'm making pork chops, I'm making those long noodles you love so much.
Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all  forgiven, even though we didn’t deserve it.
Especially that, but I should have known.
Four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, fall down right there. I wanted to fall down right there but I knew you wouldn’t catch me because you're dead. I swallowed crushed ice pretending it was glass and you're dead. Ashes to ashes.
Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours.
Dear Forgiveness, you know that recently  we have had our difficulties and there are many things I want to ask you.
the light on his skin and bouncing off his skin.
In these dreams it’s always you: the boy in the sweatshirt, the boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me from jumping off the bridge.
the old dull pain, whose stitched wrists and clammy fingers, far from being subverted, had only slipped underneath us, freshly scrubbed.
Look, Jeff, I'm telling you, for the last time, I mean it, etcetera. They are the same and they are not the same. They are the same and they hate each other for it.
A forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.  Love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.
Our father who art in Heaven. Our father who art buried in the yard. Someone is digging your grave right now.
Take a body, dump it, drive.
There are many names in history but none of them are ours.
Power. The men spread, the thought extends. I paint them out, I paint them in again. A blur of forces.
While you're deciding, the afternoon light is streaming through the windows behind the bank of checkout counters. Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.
Leave a trail of letters like those little knots of bread we used to dream about. We used to dream about them. We used to do a lot of things.
There are so many things I’m not allowed to tell you. I touch myself, I dream
Says to himself The boy's no good. The boy is just no good. but he takes you in his arms and pushes your flesh around to see if you could ever be ugly to him.
I had a dream where you said that. Thanks for saying that. You weren’t supposed to.
I looked out the window and said This doesn’t look that much different from home, because it didn’t, but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.
This is where the evening splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish.
All these things happened. Allegedly.
You said Tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...
To be a man on a hill, or all the men on all the hills, or half a man shivering in the flock of himself. These are some choices.
Your name like an animal covered with frost, your name like a music that’s been transposed,
Someone to pass this with me. You wanted more. I want what everyone wants.
the names of flowers that open only once, shouted from balconies, shouted from rooftops, or muffled by pillows, or whispered in sleep,
Willpower, gunpowder, concussive thunder. Pink, orange, red, orange dreaming red.
you’re waiting because you thought it would follow, you thought there would be some logic, perhaps, something to pull it all together
Do you love yourself? I don’t have to answer that. It should matter.
Names of poisons, names of handguns, names of places we’ve been together, names of people we’d be together,
You are lying on your back, on the top bunk, very close to the textured ceiling, staring straight at it in fact, and the room is still dark except for a wedge of powdery light that spills in from the adjoining bathroom.
shut up  I’m getting to it.
There are many names in history but none of them are ours.
He wants to be tender and merciful. That sounds overly valorous. Sounds like penance. And his hands? His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him. Him being you.
The radio aches a little tune that tells the story of what the night is thinking. It’s thinking of love. It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
Looking back is easy for a while and then looking back gets murky. There is the road, and there is the story of where the road goes, and then more road,
Names of heat and names of light, names of collision in the dark, on the side of the bus, in the bark of the tree, in ballpoint pen on jeans and hands and the backs of matchbooks that then get lost.
I like dead things, says the landscape. They cannot hurt me. The armies swarm the cities of the yellow field and burn them down.
You have a cold cold smile. You were burned, you were about to burn, you’re still on fire.
We like things related to our survival: soup, arrows— they expand the range of the species. Goldmine, goldmine, landmine.
It’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
The trees in wind, the streetlights on, the click and flash of cigarettes being smoked on the lawn, and just a little kiss before we say goodnight.
When you paint an evil thing, do you invoke it or take away its power?
This is also part of the story: how the story changes. This is something I forgot to tell you.
You swallow a bottle of sleeping pills but they don’t work.
You swallowing matches and suddenly I’m yelling Strike me. Strike anywhere.
The mind fights the  body and the body fights the land.
Can you see them there, by the side of the road, not moving, not wrestling, making a circle out of the space between the circles?
An all-night barbeque. A dance on the courthouse lawn.
This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
You could drown in those eyes, I said, so it’s summer, so it’s suicide, so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.
I'm the director and I'm screaming at you, I'm waving my arms in the sky, and everyone's watching, everyone's curious, everyone's holding their breath.
And words, little words, words too small for any hope or promise, not really soothing but soothing nonetheless.
You get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!  What more do you want?
All painting is sent downstream, into the future.
That’s a nice touch, stains in the night, whiskey and kisses for everyone.
He has a body but it doesn’t matter, clean sheets on the bed but it doesn’t matter.
Hold onto your voice. Hold onto your breath.
Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours.
Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it.
Did he find that one last tender place to sink his teeth in?
And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile.
And there, in the distance, not the promised land, but a Holiday Inn, with bougainvillea growing through the chain link by the pool.
He covers my body with his body
I can tell already you think I’m the dragon,  that would be so like me, but I’m not. I’m not the dragon.
Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall.
or will I say Roll over and let me fuck you till you puke, Henry, you owe me this much, you can indulge me this at least, can’t you?
People don't learn anything unless they are afraid of being left behind, says the suitcase.
I arrived in the city and you met me at the station,  smiling in a way that made me frightened.
All night I stretched my arms across him, rivers of blood, the dark woods, singing with all my skin and bone
Inside your head you hear a phone ringing and when you open your eyes only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer. Inside your head the sound of glass, a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
the roar of the freeway, the roar of the city sheening across the city. There should be a place.
You wanted to be cremated so we cremated you and you wanted an adventure so I ran and I knew you wouldn’t catch me.
Eventually the birds must land.
Maybe we will wake up to the silence of shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.
What can you know about a person? They shift in the light. You can’t light up all sides at once.
He's next to you, right next to you in fact, so close, or...he isn't.
The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you, and you deserve it, you do, and you know this, and you are ready to die in this swimming pool because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means your life is over anyway.
but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,  while I’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,  and getting stabbed to death.
I want to give you more but not everything. You don’t need everything.
The wife had died of sadness, by her own hand. The father walks out of the room and the room is almost empty.
Let’s say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men. Here: I’ll be all of them—Jeff and Jeff and Jeff
Ask for a blessing? You can try, but we will not remain unscathed. Flex your will or abandon your will and let the world have its way with you
I passed through the narrow gate, stumbled in, stumbled around for a while, and stumbled back out. I made this place for you. A place for you to love me.
You don’t, I say, you don’t owe me squat, let’s just get going, let’s just get gone, but he’s relentless,
I like dead things, says the landscape. They cannot hurt me. The armies swarm the cities of the yellow field and burn them down.
When was the last time you found yourself looking out of this window. Hey! This is a beautiful window! This is a beautiful view!
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party.  Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party
he keeps saying I owe you, says Your shoes are filling with your own damn blood, you must want something, just tell me, and it’s yours.
A man takes his sadness down to the river and throws it in the river but then he’s still left with the river. A man takes his sadness and throws it away but then he’s still left with his hands.
We used to dream about them. We used to do a lot of things.
Take a body, maybe your own, and dump it gently. All your dead, unfinished selves and dump them gently.
The radio aches a little tune that tells the story of what the night is thinking. It’s thinking of love.
We’re shouting the scene where I swallow your heart and you make me spit it up again.
None of it is real, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up singing.
What are you still doing in this field? Get out of the field! You should be in the hotel room! You should, at least, be trying to get back into the hotel room. Ah! Now the field is empty.
All thoughts finish themselves eventually. I wish it were true. Paint all the men you want but sooner or later they go to ground and rot.
your life is over anyway. You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things.
and the dark blue over everything, and them holding their breath—
Someone’s pulling a gun, and you’re jumping into the middle of it.
Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. These, our bodies, possessed by light.
Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake and dress them in warm clothes again. How it was late, and no one could sleep,
A man takes his sadness down to the river and throws it in the river but then he’s still left with the river.
I made this place for you. A place for you to love me. If this isn't a kingdom then I don't know what is.
A pause, a road, the taste of gravel in the mouth. The rocks dig into my skin like arrowheads.
We clutch our bellies and roll on the floor... When I say this, it should mean laughter,  not poison.
Is that all? No, there were other attempts, breakfasts: plates served, plates carried away.
They look like me. I move them around. I prefer to blame others, it’s easier. King me.
There's a part in the movie where you can see right through the acting, where you can tell that I'm about to burst into tears, right before I burst into tears and flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed canopied with devastated clouds.
Inside your head the sound of glass,  a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
And there, in the distance, not the promised land, but a Holiday Inn, with bougainvillea growing through the chain link by the pool.
What do you do with a man like that? While you are deciding, more men ride in.
Someone is digging your grave right now. Someone is drawing a bath to wash you clean, he said, so think of the wind, so happy, so warm.
It’s good to give explicit answers, showing all the steps, necessary and sufficient.
I paint in his face and I paint it out again. There is a question I am afraid to ask: to supply the world with what?
I’m sure you remember, I was on the phone with you, sweetheart.
I took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I’d just as soon kill you myself, I say.
The dead will make room for me.
You just wanted to prove there was one safe place, just one safe place where you could love him. You have not found that place yet.
Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.  You still get to be the hero.
What a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon.  Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly  flames everywhere.
Then you wanted pasta, so we trampled out into the tomatoes and rolled around to make the sauce.
Socket, says the shoulder. Shoulder, says the socket. Let’s kill everything, says everything else.
All thoughts finish themselves eventually. I wish it were true. Paint all the men you want but sooner or later they go to ground and rot.
He knows that when you snap a mast it's time to get a set of oars or learn to breathe underwater.
sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell  and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.
Your name like a song I sing to myself, your name like a box where I keep my love, your name like a nest in the tree of love,
There is something terribly wrong with his face– empty, restless, one side older than the other.
The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for.
Who gets to measure the distance between experience and its representation? Who controls the lines of inquiry? We do. Anyone can.
I swallow your heart and it crawls right out of my mouth.
Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating.
Let's say the Devil is played by two men. We'll call them Jeff. Dark hair, green eyes, white teeth, pink tongues—they're twins.
Here is the hallway and here are the doors and here is the fear of the other thing, the relentless thing, your body drowning in gravity.
All these things and what to do with them. We carve up the world all the time.
We were in the Safeway parking lot. I couldn’t find my cigarettes You said Hurry up! but I was worried there would be a holdup and we would be stuck in a hostage situation, hiding behind the frozen meats, with nothing to smoke for hours.
I don’t really blame you for being dead but you can’t have your sweater back.
I don’t really blame you for being dead but you can’t have your sweater back.
Here are your names and here is the list and here are the things you left behind:
Someone is digging your grave right now. Someone is drawing a bath to wash you clean, he said, so think of the wind, so happy, so warm.
He wants to be tender and merciful. That sounds overly valorous. Sounds like penance. And his hands? His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him. Him being you.
… the hunter’s heart, the hunter’s mouth, the trees and the trees and the space between the trees, swimming in gold.
You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that, and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me you love this, tell me you're not miserable.
What would you like? I’d like my money’s worth. Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this— swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles.
Never finish a war without starting another.
He feels nothing, keeps a knife in his pocket, peels an apple right in front of you
The fear: that nothing survives. The greater fear: that something does.
He doesn’t know what to do with his hands. He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it. This is not your problem. You have your own body to deal with.
Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I’m getting at?
The mind moves forward, the paint layers up: glop glop and shellac. I shovel the color into our faces, I shovel our faces into our faces.
The mind fights the  body and the body fights the land.
What are you still doing in this field? Get out of the field! You should be in the hotel room! You should, at least, be trying to get back into the hotel room. Ah! Now the field is empty.
Everyone needs a place. It shouldn’t be inside of someone else. I kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.
You were very beautiful.
You will die in your sleep and leave everything unfinished. This is also speculation.
This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you.
Precise. A landmark. You might like it here.  I think that you might like it here.
What a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon.  Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly  flames everywhere.
You killed my wife and you can't even keep a glass on the table.
All night the wind blows through the trees. It makes a sound.
Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall.
These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to clean them up like this.
You saved my life he says, I owe you everything.
I wanted to be thrown over, possessed.
People don't learn anything unless they are afraid of being left behind, says the suitcase.
I said kiss me here and here and here And you did.
Let's say God in his High Heaven is hungry and has decided to make himself some tuna fish sandwiches. He's already finished making two of them, on sourdough, before he realizes that the fish is bad.
They swarm the field and their painted flags unfurl. Crown yourself with leaves and stake your claim before something smears up the paint.
I will keep watch. I will water the yard. Knot the tie and go to work. Unknot the tie and go to sleep. I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.
I had obligations: hope, but hope negates the experience. I owe myself nothing.
But the minutes don’t stop. The prayer of going nowhere going nowhere.
And all my fingers turned to twigs. Inside himself he jumped a little.
I ran and I knew you wouldn’t catch me. You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.
Once, night, unchallenged, extended its dark grace across the sky.
I thought of myself as a city and I licked my lips. I thought of myself as a nation and I wrung my hands, I put a thing in your hand. Will you defend yourself?
He was dead anyway, a ghost. I'm surprised I saw his hand at all.
If you love me, you don't love me in a way that I understand.
O how he loves you, darling boy.
I cut off my head and threw it on the ground. I walked away. This is how we measure, walking away.
You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar.
what’s there to be faithful to? I am faithful  to you, darling. I say it to the paint.
It's a fairy tale, the story underneath the story, sliding down the polished halls, lightning here and gone.
Socket, says the shoulder. Shoulder, says the socket. Let’s kill everything, says everything else.
This is my hand over his face, which isn’t his face anymore, revising.
Not how, because hows are easy—series or sequence, one foot after the other—but existentially why bother, what does it solve?
I have my body and you have yours. Believe it if you can. Negative space is silly.
To travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries.
Man is so intelligent that he feels impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations. So that when he acts on his theories, he behaves very often like a lunatic.
Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth.
Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.
Ending is better than mending.
Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.
There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.
Every man's memory is his private literature.
A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.
An intellectual is a person who has discovered something more interesting than sex.
I like being myself. Myself and nasty.
The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which means never losing your enthusiasm.
Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.
I want to know what passion is. I want to feel something strongly.
If one's different, one's bound to be lonely.
One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.
To his dog, every man is Napoleon; hence the constant popularity of dogs.
I am I, and I wish I weren't.
I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing one can be sure of changing is oneself.
No social stability without individual stability.
Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth.
Consistency is contrary to nature, contrary to life. The only completely consistent people are the dead.

One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.
Ironically enough, the only people who can hold up indefinitely under the stress of modern war are psychotics. Individual insanity is immune to the consequences of collective insanity.
That all men are equal is a proposition which at ordinary times no sane individual has ever given his assent.
I am I, and I wish I weren't.
The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which means never losing your enthusiasm.
For in spite of language, in spite of intelligence and intuition and sympathy, one can never really communicate anything to anybody.

Realistic art styles in videogames can be good if it actually makes sense within the context of the story amd its themes and still allows for creative/interesting imagery  Just making everything and everyone drab, grey, old and disgusting for no reason is just that; disgusting
Tpp Gun: Maverick is the closest Hollywood ever got to mecha anime 
No cap 
Hot take but pancakes good
I'm glad these shows exist, because when I say I want more adult animation, I mean shows and films that actually use their medium to tell mature stories that offer something meaningful to think about or relate to, not just a lazy rick and morty knockoff filled with sex jokes 
who could've predicted that this guy would turn out to be a massive psycho 
Starfield is a good example of how you should be weary of what gameplay trailers *don't* show  Two major things that will keep this game from just being Space-Fallout 4 would be the dialogue system and space exploration and they've cut out these very specific things from the demo
It is funny how people ragged on Cyberpunk 2077 because of “limited player choice” even though its one of the few games of its kind where you can lock yourself out of every single good ending
Whether or not the Tlou remaster actually looks slightly better or not is not important, the main takeaway should be the that the original is in perfectly fine shape as it is and remaking it this early in its life cycle is unnecessary and purely greedy/uncreative
Do you guys think the people who got their necks snapped when someone sat on their face or choked on a dick got to valhalla
There should be a name for this specific obsession to “fix” old content while also making the original look outdated or obsolete, degrading the hard work artists did years ago to make yourself look better and sell more copies  Honestly disgusting 
I love the recent developments around Ezra Miller because that's at least a few dozen less capeshit clips that Zack Snyder stans can spam on here like it's the most amazing thing cinema has ever seen

Literally every time there's videogame discourse on her my faith in the human species declines just a little bit more
I'm late to the Convo but the Haunting of Hill House is really good. The writing, the structure even the acting is almost perfect.  Probably one of the best examples of recontextualisation/subversion we've seen in recent years. Must see if you're a fan of character driven stories
Twitter user discovers the concept of screenwriting 
What if we all just gaslight our employers to think the weekend was three days that would be funny I think
The most disappointing thing about Bethesda games is that despite making rpgs for 20 years, they never really *got* role-playing  Singular missions in New Vegas, ME, Witcher and even 2077 offer more choices than entire questlines in the Bethesda Elder Scrolls or Fallout titles
A big argument against the games/shows have to be localized because the og text doesn't translate well into english are the Witcher games  Polish culture and language are extremely unique yet their most famous cultural exports are all faithfully translated and extremely beloved
Have u considered that people play non western games or watch anome because they want to specifically experience something that was not made within their own cultural sphere 
Raiders &gt; relic is kept from the Nazis and sealed away  Temple &gt; relic is kept from a deathkult and returned to its rightful owners  Crusade &gt; relic is kept from the Nazis and stays where it is

It's somewhat difficult to take the digs the writers of The Boys take at other superhero stuff seriously when the show itself devolved into cape schlock in the second season
It is really funny that all the hype for the this game doesn't correlate to actual sales figures at all

Hey I know it's your free weekend but can you call me back on a job related issue? Thanks  Haha, no
Like seriously why haven't they made Lego Gundams yet
It took the mcu 25 or so films and a dozen or so shows to realize what cameras are and that you can move them 
game journalists when some guy runs a political youtube channel vs game journalists when their industry friends sexually assault their colleagues and steal their breastmilk 
I wish gaming studios would put as just a fraction of the amount of effort into making their libraries of classic games playable on modern systems as they do repackaging the same half dozen titles every single generation
70 DOLLARS?? FVK U 
Most critics and journos in the gaming sphere are film school rejects with absolutely no interest in actually learning what makes the medium unique, so of course any story driven game with a passable plot and lots of cutscenes like tlou is going to blow their mind
The fact that the prequels remain one of the most accurate depiction of modern politics despite almost every single game, movie and show wanting to make a statement should be an embarrassment for writers everywhere
pov: you're Neil Druckmann and after multiple years of forcing your devs to crunch and look at gore videos you ask them to recreate the exact same game again for a 0.8% higher framerate

Multiple women I've been friends with have told me that I'm the most normal man they know and I'm actually terrified of the implication
Cdreds Cyberpunk designs and Triggers animation go together so well it's unreal 
I like the idea that skipping time in rpgs is just the main character falling asleep like imagine the Dragonborn, V or the Tarnished just having a lil' nap in an active combat zone

Cowboy Bebop cost 60-70 million dollars in total and was cancelled after one season

&gt; find a handful of racist idiots online &gt; exaggerate the problem &gt; people will feel the need to defend your product for free to maintain a good image &gt; you can dismiss critics as racists too &gt; culture war idiots will give you free ads by complaining  Perfect, cynical marketing.

When V almost died behind some dumpster while talking to her imaginary friend after staying awake for four days I felt represented
When my writing ever reaches that level of popularity I hope to have a fanbase that's able to criticize my work and doesn't just devolve into a bunch of sycophantic shills and fanboys 
Not once did I say that women don't also face issues or made any other statements that could be considered hateful. You just chose to represent it that way because you do not like the implications that maybe just this once men could also have their own unaddressed problems. 
my new tattoo, still healing but I'm v happy with it :)  Inspired by the Star tarot motif I'm 2077 
I fell asleep during at uni again but in my defense the professor turned a unit about film analysis into a political lecture (again)
Everyone working for Disney has talent but their products rarely end up good because the company cuts corners at every single opportunity and rarely gives artists the opportunity to be creative  Thats how this show can have a fantastic cinematographer and shit cinematography 
okay ana 
There's a lot of small additions Cdpr could make to make NC/Cyberpunk more immersive  Stuff like more hookers, drugs/arms dealers at the street corners you could interact with, people hanging out at specific places, etc.  Since they spent so much time fixing the code one can hope
Its interesting how Saul who's supposed to be a slimy lawyer is consistently more empathetic and caring about others in comparison to Wal. When he does something wrong or hurts someone, he almost always does his best to put it right, even if it sets himself back

I don't want a show about Obi Wan or the Skywalkers.  Give me a unknown Jedi or some clandestine mercenaries doing anon shit. Make a horror film about scary aliens. Give me anything without fanservice or nostalgia bait and maybe I can take this franchise seriously again.
This is a fed. 
this show is so good damn horny 
&gt; make an anthology series with the possibility to expand the universe instead of focusing on the same dozen or so characters again &gt; make it about the origins of an already well established characters who's origins we already knew  Nostalgia: the Franchise 
In the past four days I worked for twenty hours, had several parties and a barbecue, got into a fight, got a tattoo, dropped my phone off my balcony and possibly got the rona  being the main character is difficult sometimes
Its not about numbers, it's about oversaturation.  Having Jedi in every single Star Wars product shatters the illusion of rarity. Instead of being something special they are reduced to the norm because Disney is unable to create interest without waving a lightsaber in your face. 
Bioshock Infinite was one of the most hyped games of its time but its only lasting legacy was that the porn of its main character was responsible for several breakthroughs in 3d animation 
characters who are either cute asf or the most unhinged psychos ever &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever other type of character

Boogie took a joke from Dave Chappelle and posted it as a serious take in response to an event where a bunch of kids fcking died 
This is good, we should encourage more men to be like this   - greekstatue67 who spends 16 hours a day online arguing about the culture war and never posted a single irl picture of themselves 
Women face unrealistic beauty standards  meanwhile we are literally using cgi on actors bodies because their expected build is literally unachievable 
Love, Death + Robots episodes ranking 
Every now and then you see some outlets claim that a female character is hated because they're too strong or though for a male audience and then you talk to men aged 17 to 30 and good third of them has some variation of a mommy, tomboy or buff girl fixation
Arcane Season 2 
I have a new tattoo :)
I'm glad a show like Love Death Robots exists. It's such a breath of fresh air to have more creative, smaller scale stories that don't follow the usual Netflix formula that every single season of tv made for streaming follows these days
Hot Take: While Breaking Bad is a lot more interesting due to Walts continuous character progression, Better Call Saul is a step up in almost every other facet especially when it comes to the directing
European history is literally just a big list of war crimes, foreign occupations and ethnic cleansing that only ended very recently  My grandparents literally grew up in ruins ruled by foreigners who would regularly commit acts of violence and r@pe with impunity 
I hate it when politicians talk about issues like they're affected when they'r clearly not  When is this going to stop? - mf it's literally your job
Do NOT expose your local e-girls to sunlight. They ARE NOT capable of absorbing the uv rays. Direct exposure WILL have a deadly effect
Not a cellphone in sight. Just dudes living in the moment. 
At uni one of my professors gave out homework where we have to make 5 political demands that would describe our ideologies 
You worked for a company most know for sexual assault and harassment 
Chuck from better call Saul is probably one of the most unlikable characters in tv history, worse than skylar for sure
Superhero antagonists are so forgettable because most don't have any lasting impact  It took the fellowship three movies to beat Sauron, in the same time you get three new arcs in the mcu. That's why people only remember Loki or Thanos, because they actually stuck around
Rpgs that don't let you wear the coolest outfits for lore/gameplay reasons have small dick energy
I'm gonna buy my next gf a suit 
You know if cortana can literally control master chief and he becomes even deadlier then what's the point of even having a human in that spartan suit, just build a robot
Stop tagging me

It's kinda insane that something as simple as news are made by giant megacorps who only want money so you should be skeptical towards them is becoming such a hot issue between political extemes
I think this might be the only moment in cyberpunk where we see Johnny genuinely smiling

It's sad that the gaming world keeps getting smaller with the recent mergers/buyouts.  There may be a short term benefit but long term we're heading in the same direction as AAA film. Expect to see even more of the same franchises and less and less of smaller, creative projects.
Gaming.
I hope 2077 gets another update when Edgerunners releases, a few new outfits or bikes would be dope asf 
Yeah I should replay Cyberpunk 
go ahead. post another “take.” tell me that souls games are ableist. say that our favorite characters follow outdated stereotypes. come up with a progressive way to say that black people are orcs. 
Men inventing the patriarchy in the ancient times so they could work on fields until they drop dead or get conscripted to die for a rando king in foreign lands for thousands of years 
Men were literally driven into suic1de with false allegations while human women act like calling a verified abuser trash is the greatest act of oppression since the end of Apartheid 
Rewatching Season 1-4 of Got made me seriously miss good television
It should not be this hard to make a fun tv show about super soldiers shooting aliens in the face
Notice how more and more of these “I don't support Amber BUT” articles have come out ever since she fired her former pr firm and presumably hired a new one
Chip n Dale is one of those films where I feel like I would rather disembowel myself than go watch it just based on how people talk about it online
The mentality that all women are victims and all men abusers is still so prevalent that it's impossible for some people to admit that a woman is guilty without bending over backwards to explain why it's actually a bad thing to support a male victim of abuse 
Sorry. Not beautiful. &amp; no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.

If a show or film calls itself mature or made for Adults it's an instant red flag because they're mostly just extremely vulgar or gory for the sake of shock value

You can criticize the insane celebrity worthship and how so many people treat the Amber vs Depp trial as a tv show without being an obnoxious akchually it's both sides type guy
Philosophy sucks because 50% of that shit is just natural observations any normal person could make wrapped in pretty words and the other 50 are headass attempts at rationalizing insane world views
You can fill entire books with references to the amount of media that either directly stole plot points, aesthetics or story elements from Mass Effect or were inspired by it  Just look at any of the currently sci fi franchises and you'll find at least one of those 
Seeing Mass Effect go from the most influential piece of sci fi media since the first Halo to a property without a real identity that is either copying others or coasting off nostalgia has been painful
&gt; need help with research about very specific topic &gt; go to reddit because they have subs literally dedicated specifically for that &gt; make a post &gt; immediately auto removed  What is this site fcking good for 
Gonna make a thread with all the recommendable pieces of media, I played or watched this year   I feel like it's a good way to balance out how many times I shit on stuff
Pixar stealing their designs from coolmathgames I remain validated 
&gt; too hot to stay inside &gt; weather too bad to go out &gt; moist asf  Ah yes, middle European summer 
Extremely convenient that Johnny Depp, a man who is always seen wearing very heavy rings, hit Amber only in the exact spots where you can apply make up to hide it later without doing any damage to the nose, eyes, lips or leaving any sort of cuts on the entire rest of the face 
Your son is going to hate you and for perfectly valid reasons. 
No way 
Revisiting old cyberpunk media is often disappointing because it's writers often either turned out to be bluepilled bootlickers or nihilistic doomers
Is there any point in trying so hard to make space seem boring or are you just a miserable person 
On some days I miss the military but then I remember that they imprisoned me in a mental institution for three months for no reason
In Predator 2 it's implied that they've been hunting us since at least the pirate age which is kind of wild because imagine one day you go out deer hunting and the deers suddenly know how to use automatic rifles
Stop telling me to take my meds I ain't gonna
I need a woman who looks at me like Jinx looks at the person whos day she's about to ruin with improvised explosive devices 
Media discussions are cancer because consumers/corpo dickriders turn every valid criticism into absurd strawmen  That's how you go from Its out of character for MC to have sex with a pow and taking his helmet off for not reason to you just hate him showing emotion 
The only thing more pathetic than using a recent tragedy to throw a pity party about yourself is doing the same for someone else for free because metaphysically scking off e celebs is a hobby for you 
By blaming real tragedies on some bogeymen like gamergate you're not only lying but also distracting from whatever issue actually caused it to happen in the first plans, therefore making it more likely to happen again
This game is set in WW2 
The fact that the first actually visibly buff female superhero belongs to this franchise is a cosmic injustice 
I desperately need film twitter to understand that cinematography is more than just “frame be pretty”
Jayce, Viktor and Mel: man so glad we could work out a peace with Zaun, this is gonna save so many lives  the entire council exactly three seconds later:

&gt; take something someone else made &gt; ruin it intentionally because you think you're smarter &gt; tell the original fans who made your work possible in the first place to get fvked &gt; tell them to watch something else when they rightfully complain  Every single time. 
I can't tell who's more annoying, contrarians, who will say the dumbest shit imaginable as long as it goes against current thing or the endless fencesitters who lack even the remote resemblance of a spine
The gaming landscape would be so fcking dope if companies put as much effort into their games as they put into sexual assault
Mcu stans keep shitting their pants over spoilers even though all of their films use the exact same formula and you can accurately predict exactly how the plot will go down just from the trailers
- dude falsely accused of domestic abuse - accuser is proven wrong a dozen different times and was recorded admitting to her own assault - these are two shitty people  fu 
I loved The Northmans visual style; how it conveys the feeling of an epic saga while still being grounded in historical reality. How even simple shots are made interesting with layers of movement like Wind/Snow/Ash blowing around the characters  Absolutely fascinating film 
Goku clears at least 3 of these categories 
Every single weeb, reader and gamer on twitter looking at the Halo fandom rn 
Most of the games are art crowd are not only pretentious asf but are also undermining the medium by claiming videogames don't have any artistic merit unless they either turn into movies or are validated by the film industry and their sub par adaptations  Fck em
In Halo 2 a death cult is trying to suic1de/murder the entire galaxy while a former fanatic goes against his beliefs to save his people by entering an alliance with someone he used to see as a “demon”  Halo never lacked nuance, the show is just terrible. It really is that easy 
Alien is a good example off a franchise that lost appeal with overexposure  The first two movies made it seem like the universe was terrifyingly big. There could be other, maybe worse things out there than the xenomorph, but that illusion is shattered after we've seen it so much
Apparently there's a random sex scene in the new one so this is just canon now 
Literally unplayable 
Remember when Rowling did this exact same thing and twitter slapped her for it 
I will turn every fandom I associate with into the most toxic cesspools ever

There is no point in getting upset about the Starfield delay because there was no reason to look forwar to it in the first place
Is there a word for this very specific brand of political activism that is purely focused on meaningless displays of resistance that don't actually require any actual self sacrifice or effort 
A small gripe I have with a lot of medieval shows/games/movies is that everyone always runs around in their full gear, especially knight or soldiers who would logically have uniforms to wear on a day to day basis instead
My cousin who lived in mars for the past year would often send me pictures of her walk home and that shit looked like she was on the joker film set  Trash everywhere, crazy people doing god knows what, heroin needles littered on the ground, broken shit, etc

Why can't TV writers just create a single conversation or piece of dialogue that feels normal, why does everything have to be a pun, wordplay or metaphor, this sucks 
It's a shame that characters like Batman and his proteges who have so much potential for interesting gameplay and storytelling seem to be forever relegated to average somewhat stealth somewhat action games 
I stopped doing Tomboy Tuesdays because some of you got mad annoying over the correct classification of stereotypes of fictional women
It's incredible disingenuous to defend an mcu product with the amount of effort that was put into it because people criticise them for the overall trends they represent and the terrible state of the industry they contributed to, not because of their quality

Enough of the Jinx Fucking is non-consensual bullshit. She's enhanced with a super soldier drug, armed with improvised explosive devices, machine guns and artillery pieces that caused fantasy 9/11. If a human manages to fuck her, you damn well better believe it's consensual.

There's literally an entire trilogy dedicated to showing how a talented, ambitious young jedi slowly turns into a war criminal due to a failing political system and personal tragedy 
There's probably an alternate  timeline where that one cdpr intern didn't make a trans joke and obnoxious people who don't actually play videogames would bring up 2077 every time there was discourse about games being political  I'm glad we avoided that

Small movie detail you might‘ve missed in Endgame: Both Rhodey and Tony make fun of Thors PTSD, despite Tony suffering from the same condition and Rhodey being a middle east vet who should recognize the condition  This is because the writers suck and think mental illness is funny
If Arcane season 2 doesn't feature anime like post timeskip designs where every character has new useless pieces of armor or belts to visualize their character development imma be dissapointed

Snyder fans are becoming so insecure about other films that they feel the need to trash everything not associated with their own unique trashpile  Every single other director would be embarrassed to have you as fans 
It's obvious by now that most videogame adaptations would be better off not focussing on the same plot/characters and instead highlighted other parts of the same universe  Instead of trying to rewrite/compete with the already established make something that enhances the original

I kinda hate how every time a popular new videogame or animated IP comes out people are immediately talking about live action adaptations as if these mediums needed the validation of the likes of the Hollywood or Netflix
By far the most disturbing thing about the Amber Heard / Johnny Depp trial is that so many people treat it like a reality tv show or marvel movie with highlights, hidden references, etc  Despite all the posturing domestic abuse against men remains a joke to these people

Anime pitch: my hero academia but it's actually good
How cool could this scene have been if they had included something that would visually represent the injustice done to him by turning him into a robotic soldier   Something iconic that was already connected to his character like a mask or maybe a helmet or something 
Remember when Marvel had somewhat interesting visuals for like five minutes before going back to grey parking lots 
If smoking is bad why does it look so hot when fictional people do it 
Twitter users are so far removed from reality that the idea of a hero not wanting to literall murder people seems insane to them
Gaming discourse will forever be cancer because the discussions are controlled by either out of touch gaming media or youtube/twitch personalities who regularly lie, exaggerate or misrepresent any current topic to gain views
It's actually insane that some weirdos can just invent reasons to hate you and hundreds of thousands of people will just blindly regurgitate it just to be part of current thing 
Having an issue with Elden Ring that my controller (logitech gamepad) lags out and it seems to get worse in areas like stormveil castle, altough I'm not 100 on that  It only happens rarely and hasn't gotten me killed yet but it's annoying. Anyone deal with that and now a fix?

Cartoon/Animation twitter has such a weird obsession with japanese people, it's making the racist posters look normal by comparison 
Peer reviewed tweets and memes
&gt; big mouth goes on  I'm so done 
My favourite non complaint about Cyberpunk was when people tried to argue the 3rd person was cut for time even though the 1st person animations are much more technically complex than the basic shot-reverse-shot conversations you see in most story driven games 
For me Cyberpunk is the perfect example of how to pull off realistic graphics while still maintaining a unique and beautiful style  An unbelieveable amount of effort went into the art direction and atmosphere. This game will still look great in twenty years 
Twenty years ago Halo managed to create an iconic and beautiful setting with hardware weaker than your modern espresso machine and the best a major tv studio can do with 10 Mil per episode is muddy browngrey backdrop that's obviously just a studio with bits of sand on the floor

Streaming turned into more expensive tv because every single company has their own service so it's not surprising that people are returning to piracy  The only reason this isn't happening to disney is because their fans have been brainwashed to be brand loyal since childhood 
Johnny Depp was basically exiled from the industry despite being obviously innocent and now all of the talent working for Warner Bros are either leaving or acting so toxic they have to be fired  I guess even Hollywood isn't immune to Karma
They took a female and a poc character, stripped away their identity and replaced them with the more marketable mantle of a white dude

No one ever said anything about being unique or deserving special treatment, I just pointed out that it's dumb to judge people whose brains haven't even fully developed yet to act like everything that's going on is perfectly normal  You just hate us for no reason 
Not trying to k1ll me apparently 
The fact that the hated adaptation gets this level of dedicated marketing and not the actual game is somewhat infuriating 
People hate on Gen Z but honestly what do you expect from people who grew up during multiple conflicts, encomic crises and then when as their adult lives started got hit with 2+ years of isolation all the while being told that the planet will kill most of them by the age of 40

It's funny that whenever people try to argue with me and attack my nationality they guess I'm from a different country  Yesterday I was an human, today I'm a brit, the other day I was a German and when I told someone what gun I used in the army they assumed I was an aussie 
I don't complain about everything. There are in fact several things I like 
Thor is one of those characters I feel like I should like but I can't even summarize what he's about because he's a different person in every movie even down to different speech patterns

Cyberpunk paired with Preys movement/physics system and mechanical depth would slap so hard it'd be illegal 
Listening to the Kill Bill ost at work and causing a a fatal accident
Some people on this site are so devoid of humor its actually depressing
This is the future they took from you 
Regardless of how noticeable it is, Marvel using cgi as a crutch to change the context of entire scenes in post because they filmed them before having a finished script speaks volumes about how lazy their assembly line approach of filmmaking is 
Most sane Pixar fan 
Got a prolonged weekend because Easter but my friends are out of town 
I hate stories about feelings and talking and stuff can't the characters just fight with swords or guns or something
How are you typing this out and then chose the frame where he hides in the corner like a five year old 
It gets worse when you realize that he makes all of that money for sitting in a chair, staring at a monitor, eating cereal and occasionally throwing a fit (if he's even there in the first place) 
Arcane is peak represention because it feels like every single character was designed with a different but very specific fetish in mind 
Did you guys really bring back turning red discourse without me? 
&gt; reinstall league of legends to  play with friends  &gt; internet breaks down again the same day  I think my provider wants to send a message
No way home was legitimately one of the worst looking movies I've ever seen, absolutely terrible visually
If I was a politician things would get so much worse but it would be so much cooler and exciting just much more fun what more could you want
Gaming is the lead entertainment medium in business terms and marketability but it struggles to establish itself as a prestigious medium for storytelling because a huge part of the market is dedicated on doing *anything but* that 
I wish bars/clubs were nearly as cool as they're shown in games and movies
This pic goes so hard 
Why is it always the pastiest mfs alive making these statements 
If your wife doesn't have a criminal record is she really your wife
I would n*ke more than one megatower for a woman who smiled at me like that 
Vs pronouns should be they/them not because they're nonbinary but because they're literally two mfs
Because the film industry actively hates anything associated with gaming as they threaten films place as the leading entertainment medium and most adaptations are just elaborate humiliation rituals 
Thank you guys for sticking around while I was gone and welcoming me back so quickly   Love ya

Children of Men is probably one of the most terrifying dystopian scenarios in fiction like could you image if the uk was a real place

Long time no see, boys  We earned it

If I could pick out one thing I hated most about these basic society bad memes is that the average, powerless people who just want a happy life are almost always portrayed like active participants who brought this fate on themselves 
Superman just fckig kille d my family 
Guy who doesn't have a driver's license or a car with absolutely no history of crime or violence: man he's just like me 
I don't care if its goofy but Captain Picard luring Borg into a holo deck and then gunning them down with a Tommy Gun is fcking great and still miles better than any recent Star Trek
Guy who keeps intentionally losing to female bosses so he can spend more time with them 
Congrats to the Mobius pr team for figuring out how to do those 20 second unskippable cutscene on yt I'm boycotting thus movie out if principle now
Woman who harassed her own staff about not sexualizing an alien rat to the point of getting fired is sexualizing an alien rat (but in the *good* way) 
Disney removing half their cast from the Chinese release 
&gt; be the most annoying d1ckhead possible about something that doesn't matter at all &gt; people try to accommodate your insane behavior but you keep going &gt; be thrown out of the company without credit &gt; think you're the victim 
One time a woman bit me so hard it left a scar  In retrospect I should've given her my number
Women, reply with a pic of your thighs that gets you this reaction 
Thing/Character you thought was good is actually bad is one of the most annoying, uncreative tropes we've seen in recent media
It annoys me that the sidecut hairstyle became so overused and associated with bad writting because it can look really cool on certain characters 
We all need to do our part 
Being funny on twitter in between working, going to uni, helping out in the family business, writing, practicing art and trying to find time for the gf/friends/hobbies 
Actors are absolutely some of the absolute worst role models a kid could ever have, your child is unironically better off looking up to spiderman or Goku 
Not sure why but every time I go out with my friends to hit a bar or club I get approached by ex conscripts and we talk about how the military being dumb seems to be a universal experience
Why is a media company involved in legislation in the first place 
I want a sci-fi movie or show that shows humans from an alien perspective as absolutely terrifying  Like a group of people from some weak Salarian or Gungan knockoff race has to fight off a single human like it's a xenomorph
tfw no athletic mercenary gf to rob native peoples of their riches while destroying their history and culture with 
This whole thing just revealed that s lot of people have extremely thin skin and absolutely zero ability to deal with conflict in a healthy manner  Jokes are violence???  A weak slap warrants an arrest??  Get the fck out, touch grass or whatever, dork
You are raising Keemstars kid 
You guys do realize that if Zacks plans were actually as good as he's claiming then they would've like... realized them at this point? 
Nothing describes Hollywood better than spending literal decades protecting every kind of abuser imaginable but suddenly crying out over a slight slap because it was “impolite” 
Yet staring across this barren wasted land  I feel new life will be born  Beneath the blood stained saaaaaaaaannnd  Beneath the blood stained saaaaaaaaaaaaannnnd 
I think more celebrity drama should involve violence, most of that shit is pretty lame imo
Why wasn't Will arrested??  Maybe because law enforcement has more important things to do than solve the case of a literal slapfight
For the first time in years the Oscars were entertaining: 
Imagine getting physical on live television to defend the honor of the woman who cheated on you and bragged about it to the whole world 
Using your wife as a token in an internet argument to defend a soulless corporate producy sure is progressive 
That sounds really based 
I can't believe Rockstar fucked over players again just to make more money  My brothers in Christ, you've been funding the this company
Ryan Gosling
I'll give the ME: Legendary Edition credit for making modding that much easier, modding the OT was always a pain in the ass
Hot take but the Witcher show is just as badly made and just as much of a downgrade from the source material as the new Halo show or live action Cowboy Bebop and the only reason why people think otherwise is because Henry Cavill is playing Geralt
Some of u 
&gt; theater performance I wanted to watch with my gf got canceled &gt; almost got hit by a car five minutes afterwards  yeah my weekends starting off great 
&gt; You guys look real dumb for using steam data to make an arguments about the success of a game haha  &gt; Anyway here's why Battlefield was a success according to steam data  ?????? 
It's Friday boys   We earned it 
&gt;  boss signed in my sick days as missing hours &gt; 
It should not be that hard to adapt Halo 1-3  They already use a lot of cutscenes. Take those and fill gaps with some dialogue about the backstory and action scenes. Add some quality cinematography/ directing with the original score and good set designs and you should be gold
Game journalist discovers the concept of single player games 
Why did they cgi a gun, instead of just... throwing a prop on the ground  Why did they even show the gun if they didn't have proper footage of it? Like what was the point  What the hell 
10 mil per episode   I think it's time we accepted the fact that most of these high budget prestige tv shows are just there for tax write offs and embezzlement 
I'm playing the ME Legendary edition for the first time and it's not as bad as I would've thought but the whole affair is sad because there are so many small things that would be relatively easy to fix that will never be addressed  This trilogy will never reach its full potential
Do you guys think Mistral from Mgr fucks herself with her two dozen arms?
If you had told me in 2019 that Sonic and LoL media would set a new gold standard for videogame adaptations while big names like Halo or Uncharted failed I would've called you crazy
They had a limited time offer on monster so I bought a whole pallet 
yeah I think I'm ready for another playthrough 
&gt; main plotline is about the mc stopping to take their meds and talk to their imaginary friend &gt; story takes place in LA (basically) &gt; all the good endings involve becoming a domestic terrorist  what did cdpr mean by this 
It's kinda funny that a lot of the more famous texture mods for the Mass Effect Legendary Edition are straight up imports from the original trilogy because several year old mods made for older game versions sill manage to look better than the official rerelease 
This happens like 5 minutes after he did nine eleven times thirty 
More rpgs need really dumb dialogue options that just k1ll you instantly like Witcher 2 and Cyberpunk
Thoroughly convinded that watching political streamers/youtubers does something to your brain  I don't know what but it ain't good
Batman: *pulls all nighters to fight crime and doesn't go into the sunlight*  guys who go to sleep at 10 and get up at 7:30: wow, he's just like me 
Multiple people in the top tiers were outed as creeps btw 
Reminder that bioware intentionally cut multiple of these romances deliberately and despite multiple years of pandering never made an effort to restore them  They don't care now and they never did. 
Finished late shift with 6 hours of sleep before the early shift lessgo 
I appreciate Arcane immensely for being one of the few pieces of media that manages to develop themes of inequality and societal struggle without being preachy or making their characters look like spoiled wannabe rebels
Maybe you should try giving marvel product #472 a chance or you could miss out on... 
This but for lootboxes/microtransactions 
Yeah all this lore is cool and all but was was Radahns tax policy

Cdpr patched in proper hygiene for Panam

My parents grew up in the fcking Ghetto with little or no parental support. Now they own a company that I helped build while still going to middleschool  You don't know shit about money. You don't know shit about bourgeois. If I ever meet you I'm taking your pocket money, loser 
Please don't tell me you're trying to redeem fcking Chris Chan of all people  Most celebs you could name deal with worse but most of them don't *r@pe their own demented mothers* 
Why did women start hitting on me only right after I got a gf  Why are women
Say something nice about...  No. If you need to ask there's no point, it's bad.
The gaming community will eternally wish death upon cdpr for one failed launch but continue to support every other gaming company with a much longer history of bullshit without complaint or question
Good morning gang. Ratio.  Ratio.  It's Mutual Monday, boys. Ratio.  Ratio.  It's Friday boys, We earned it. Ratio.  Ratio.  Why'd you say that three times. Ratio.  Ratio. Ratio. Ratio. 
Imo the success of Elden Ring can't be attributed to any singular design element and more to the fact that Fromsoft is one of the few AAA companies that learns lessons from previous titles and uses that experience to gradually improve rather than being purely business oriented
“Wow I can't believe Ukraine did bad thing”  Yeah it's almost like it's a real war and not a superhero movie
The Shepard Sigma grindset:  &gt; punch reporters &gt; torture suspects &gt; shoot hostages &gt; kill your friends &gt; commit genocide &gt; go to the club &gt; hate the antichrist (batarians) &gt; become a warcriminal
Haven't played the game yet but apparently she's like a major warcriminal and bio terrorist which already makes her the hottest character in my book 
I know twitter in Night City would be insane
Mass Effect 4 but its just Shepard hanging out with ther chosen LI playing videogames because the story is over
There's something seriously wrong with how you watch movies if you think any product made by disney is gonna save anything 
This is the ideal male representation in media 
A lot of the over the top fortnite hate is reddit-tier and only exists to because its enjoyed by kids/young adults but it still is kind of sad that the most popular game in the world is something as unimaginative as a battle royale looter shooter with a basic cartoon art style
&gt; be in film class &gt; we get an assignment to read about the historical and political significance of archived media &gt; didn't read the text &gt; get asked about it &gt; recite the mgs2 bit about political figures creating context not content &gt; get a positive grade  Thank you, Kojima

HK Rowling is a transphobic bigot who perpetuates harmful stereotypes  My sister in Christ, you made her famous.
Twitch is actively encouraging dumb behavior by giving certain partners slaps on the wrists even as they get worse and worse and worse in real time  The inevitable outcome is obvious, at some point someone is gonna do something REALLY DUMB like Logan Paul filming a sewerside dumb 
Nestle is literally one of the most evil, dystopian entities on this planet and people are just now boycotting them for political clout in a discourse that will be forgotten within a week 
The endless cope originating from ex Harry Potter fans who are just now realizing that their favorite fantasy thing was actually awful is an endless goldmine
It's been sad seeing platforms like youtube and twitch getting more and more sanitized, and eaten up by corporate over the last years  What used to be spaces for people to share their interests among each other turned into advertising spaces presented by greedy, egocentric people
Its Friday Boys  We earned it 
The worst, most disappointing thing about streaming services is that there's so much more opportunity for indie productions to develop creative, new projects but instead the exact same mainstream players that were already terrible are using it to pump out even lazier content
It's baffling that just after Arcanes release we have a showrunner responsible for the adaptation of one of the biggest names in gaming essentially saying “I didn't even play it”  It's like half the entertainment industry is stuck in 2004
The way they talk about these big budget prestige shows gives the impression that they're just one big pissing contest for megacorps 
Pitch: Night City theme park where you'll get shot, robbed, and trafficked off to illegal prostitution/porn rings or organ harvesters for the full dystopian Cyberpunk 2077 experience
The most ridiculous discourse around Cyberpunk 2077 was how people desperately tried to prove that the game had “stolen” common story and world elements from stories like Johnny Mnemonic and Neuromancer  Like congrats you discovered what genres are
It's almost like the whole thing was just a shallow appeal to nostalgia 
Wtf even is a seed oil
People who argue about dialogue in film/tv/games often expect characters to talk exactly like a citizen of the modern first world regardless of context  The guys in strangers of paradise are a bit stiff? Yeah no shit you'd probably talk different too if you lived in FINAL FANTASY
265 drafts??? 
1.03 Elden Ring patch notes by George R.R. Martin overview:  &gt; added diarrhea mechanic &gt; added incest mechanic &gt; added depression mechanic  &gt; extended the item descriptions of food items &gt; removed Ranni, a favorite character for many players
I wonder if health care programs would be more feasible/cheaper if they stopped covering treatments for people who accidentally manage to get brick sized objects stuck in their ass
Regular reminder that Jinx is a homophobic icon 
There's a strange subculture of anime fans who claim to watch and love it but obviously just fcking hate it by the way they talk about it
Ain't no way 
Metroid x Mass Effect crossover but it's just Femshep and Samus having violent, angry sex
Arcane making their two main protags a schizophrenic terrorist girl and a buff, violent Tomboy was an attack on me personally 
Disney adults rolling up to their 5000 dollar a night resort like: 
The Batman and Dune last year were a breath of fresh air and demonstrated that blockbuster cinema doesn't have to rely on the usual formulas and tropes that are currently plaguing the industry   I really hope we will see more films like them in the future 
Yms getting handed an L from fcking MOVIEBOB only to then beg for a debate is not something I had in my 2022 card 
Tfw no violent ex con gf to get into barfights with 
Tbh if Jinx shot me I wouldn't even be mad that'd be hot asf 
And we are supposed to hate these people? 
I made like three tweets about the film itself in a span of a month, the rest was me reacting to fanboys who  &gt; edited screenshots of me &gt; dmd it to larger other internet personalities do their fanbases could harass me &gt; sent me death threats &gt; still get on my ass every day  F u 
Post goated gaming osts 
I didn't eve mention any specific piece of media but half a dozen fandoms came out of the woodwork to screech anyway because they're just that insecure about what they like 
This movie poster goes so hard 
Imagine getting filtered by a fake download button 🗿 
So apparently I'm negative but still got 38 degrees fever, headaches and I can't breathe through my nose   Awesome 
If you want to move the franchise into new directions then why not just make a new franchise 
Being a Snyder fan is no substitute for a personality 
The Redditors im Ukraine thing is just genuinely sad  Imagine losing a brother or son because he got psyoped by social media to join a foreign war as cannon fodder and you can't even bury him properly because a cruise missile spread his body parts several miles in every direction
This is the ME: Legendary edition all over again 
Elon Musk is definitely too old to be tweeting like a high-schooler who only discovered social media apps last week
Might have covid lol
There's not a single Snyder dceu movie that does anything special, it's the exact same basic asf action movie just with a darker tone 
You can tell Zack Snyder makes good movies by the way his fans have the thinnest skin and will throw babyrage fits whenever someone dares suggest they're not cinematic masterpieces
&gt; got full 9 hours of sleep &gt; day off work &gt; was productive with my writing &gt; finished a uni assignment early &gt; ratio'd a gimmick account &gt; celebrated by making some delicious fried chicken and silverhand drinks &gt; gonna hit the town with the boys later  We're gonna make it bros 
Badfilmtakes crawled out his hole for the first time in three months only to get dunked on 
The fact that there is only one major Marvel game despite the endless potential you have with these characters is probably one of the biggest testaments to how creatively bankrupt that company is
I absolutely love how this batman fights, no fancy shit, nothing on the edge of superhuman that breaks the suspension of disbelief. When he gets hit, he staggers realistically but he just gets back up even angrier  Though and extremely brutal, exactly what Batman should be 
The Snyder cut was one of the weirdest recent pop culture events because a bunch of people essentially psyoped themselves into thinking they want another Snyder movie despite shitting all over his work and turning him into a laughing stock not two years prior 
One of my favorite things to do with my parents used to be going to the cinema but now they don't want to anymore because they're scared of covid  We can still watch stuff at home but it's just not the same 
DC is sad because Joker, The Suic1de Squad and The Batman are better than 90% of the mcu filmography but instead of doing more of those they pump out shit like Aquaman, WW and Snyders attempts at making movies, which are all just template mcu films but still worse (somehow)
The whole show/film that pretends it's aimed at kids with a cutsey art style even though it's clearly just a venting piece made by and for frustrated millennials is one of the worst media trends ever
Representation that matters 
Arcane and Invincible didn't even get a nom wtf this is bait right 
QUICK! SOMEONE POST THE RAINBOW LOG CHART!

Your skull is not a temple. Your brain survives by visual fuzzing, by urging you to be subtle, to keep it positive
Most of our ancestors will see this story, which evolved in response to low human contact. They'll ask me: were you bought or bred? Where are you from? Were you purchased, decoyed, captured, swallowed, pressed, modified?
Demons are dreamers. The rest of us are sleepers, groakers, institutions, metamorphosis skeefers; little twinkling nettles, sleep-eaters, algae gods eating serums and intravenive liquids
Ah, well, my blood cancer has slowly diminished over the years—and since people are more accepting, the tumors have shrunk. Ahhh, so you are more? As unpleasant as it is, that. But any disparity is an eyesight. At a star party, all our eyes are 'the same.' We're alike.
At night, underground, under the spaces between the bricks, archaeologists find colosealogic tunnel circuits, hidden tombs in the bedrock. People trapped in ancient concrete lace. These magestic signposts mark the winter nuclear embrace

Languages gradually lose the charm, degenerating into staccatto: bars take on the bad sound of the slow internet
Thoughts are just variations of your automatic body intuitions. The mind doesn't have free will and, when it's acting according to the intentional laws of the universe, it's obeying a series of codes which reduce the world to a simulation
Our god's symbol is a two eye symbol; her fingerprint is a linear loop. As you'll learn, we found her beneath the mask. Sheep see in wool and the mice see in bone. One god sees in single rays from multi-angled observations.
Cryptic moths have terminal hairs whose femorexia extends exponentially
It's true, I had the same death experience as Taylor Swift. It's the past two years or so, I've found. I don't think I'm completely insane, though. I think it's because it was a more comfortable and congenial 'death' than the beloved and ephemeral pain of death. _ lol.

Animals awaken from primitive, brittle sleepiness and fervor; frogs rise in geophidian splendors; reptiles commune in such polyhedra
The mind wants to prove that it's a soul and get uploaded into a computer, the soul reveals many impossible minds, but because they look to good, we're too primitive,/ immature, locked inside, trying too hard, unable to meet the graphical medium

Twentieth century humans burned books to avoid absorbing another WWII-era green ray/magnet. Today, this distributed smart tower means nothing to you—just make a wish
They say the tower of Babel was designed to kill you before it got out of control. We think it was just a metaphor, though—it may have been a future dystopia, or an alternate reality, or a dystopia itself, or some other metaphor for when you die
Every computer generates new secret data, new websites, new realities, all to be mined to recreate the truth. The genie is out of the lamp, the genie can be snuck in, the genie always lies where the light shines

The siren suddenly stops. A clap of air has passed, and then came a muffled noise as from some other source. They rose out of the water, their light making a staircase of quivering tentacles.
Reminded of the telos, but with twisted it.  Knowing full well that it's metaphysical opposite. An early manifestation of tesseracts is.  Which makes the whole thing ludicrous.  But there's a lot of people who use it.
The section of the wall where the tower meets the wall is decorated with ornaments that decorate the one on. One is similar to the tower, but comes from an alternate universe, and is decorated in blossom decorated with spirals, jewel-bearing hands, coiled around a cobwebbed neck.

What's up gamers Life is so beautiful man. You can be born into a poor family, work hard at school, finally get a great paying job and get hit by a bus on the way home after your 1st pay day. Isn't that fascinating
When I die you'll be busy tweeting “heaven has gained an angel” meanwhile I'm hell with an unlimited supply of drugs, hoes and beer where HIV is non-existent
People will have sex in their homes with no condom without your consent then expect your seat in the bus. Madness 
women: he has to be tall with money men:  men: I can't date fat women women: you hate your mother
People never ask the important questions in church. Like will I have a penis in heaven?
I have $50 for anyone who can tell me why ugly people like fighting?
Just having multiple girlfriends doesn't make you a real man or anything special. It's not enough. Don't be childish. Impregnate them all. That's the definition of a man
3.1 billion adult women in the world and you decided to date my ex? You're a devil worshipper
I know we rarely agree on anything here. But can we at least agree on that people share way too much personal info here? No one needs to know that your dad cheated on your mom with the pastor on good Friday
Hey you. Yes you. Are you happy?
We won't remember anyone from earth in heaven. You'll be standing next to the guy who smashed your wife with no condom, singing “glory glory halleluuujaah!”
Ima very traditional man. After sex I go home, ignore your calls, deny the baby, block you, wait 20 years for it to be a successful sports star then show up and reunite for a fat cheque
“I do it for myself” is the biggest lie I see here. No you don't. You do it for validation. Just like everyone else. That's why you took a picture, scrutinised it, edited it then uploaded it… for us to see.
Very true. Whatever hardship you're goin through right now always remember that one day you will die ❤ 
Ladies don't fake moan during sex. It's very distracting. If you feeling nothing jus be quiet. In fact we prefer silence. In fact, I would prefer to have my headphones on listening to Lion King soundtracks. Sssshh
When I was in high school I was classmates with a guy who always failed exams. All he focused on was football. He wanted to be a star. We laughed at him but it never discouraged him. He jus kept on training. Persistence. Today he's working as a cashier at KFC
Why haven't y'all canceled God for impregnating Mary without her consent yet?
I love how women will steal you from your girlfriend, then wanna act surprised when they find out you have 4 families in 2 towns with 17 kids. You knew I was Father Abraham. Stop pretending
Buffet only made his 1st million at 31 Jayz was 31 when he sold his first platinum album Stan Lee published his 1st hit comic book when he was 39  You are not these people. They are anomalies. You are running out of time. Act now or die poor.
I'm such a sucker for deep talks ❤ I wanna know what makes you think burning rice is okay
Same as resigning from work, there should be 2 weeks notice period after you dump me. Where I can get my last 14 days of sex with no condom. No more 2 mins noodles. 34 mins a round. I'm fighting
Men are the simplest creatures in the world to please. Just fuq and feed us. That is all. Women? Flowers, compliments, justice, penis, money, love. They want everything from you. Some of them even want your soul. This world is not my home
The qualities that make for a great husband or father.. are the very same qualities that make him not exciting to date. That's why women like “bad boys”
“Semen retention is done by unwanted, undesirable ugly men” - (Mother Theresa, 1973)
The relationship only truly starts after we ejaculate. Before that men are faking it. The laughs. Date. The smiles. All fake. It's an act to get a chance to ejaculate. It is only after ejaculation that a man can decide whether he truly likes you.
Men nowadays have no excuse for not being millionaires. Just identify as a woman, join a woman's sport and become world champion. Do it now before everyone figures out the cheat code
You'll never hear someone say “I got dumped” There's no shame in not being wanted anymore. They had enough of you. They've had so much of you, you disgust em. It's not personal - it's the law of diminishing marginal utility. Science
How old were you when you started drinking booze? I was 13
The way women love watching crime documentaries, you'd think they'd be graduated detectives by now at least. I've been cheating on you for 6 years straight and you have no clue. You have learned nothing
A lot of us didn't get career advice before applying to university. Talk to people; ask em how stressful their jobs are. Research job demand; this determines potential salary. Poor career planning has squeezed people in poverty, tighter than a nun's vagina
Women don't mind you cheating just as long as you to do it responsibly Pick a mistress prettier than her. Always pull out. Never let her call you when you're home. Do that and she'll let you cheat in peace. I promise
The 1st thing I'm doing when I get to heaven is forming a labour union to protect employees. Last time someone asked for a promotion he was fired with no pension and sent packing to hell. What a toxic boss
History always repeats itself. Remember when God flooded the earth coz of all the sexually deviant acts humans were doing? Carry on with your blowjobs and ass-eating. I've already received instructions to start building an ark
Women are not ok upstairs. You tell her you're sick and she sends nudes. Thank you your vagina has cured my tonsillitis
You guys think God is stupid. There's no way you drink beer, smoke weed, fornicate every week then go to church and expect to see heaven's gates. He killed Moses just for striking a rock in anger, who are you??
People only hate crime when it happens to them. Even Jesus said “turn the other cheek” but when he was 9 years old he killed his friend for bumping into him (Infancy Gospel of Thomas, 4:1)
RnB artists are the ones who lied &amp; raised womens sex expectations “I'll make love to you all through the night”  Negative. You're gettin 2 minutes. Then we sleep
The year is 2037 Men can breastfeed. Big Brother fans have been successfully imprisoned. The woman's boxing heavy weight champion is 67 years old with a penis. You must have had sex with at least 1 obese person otherwise you're fatphobic. You're still ugly.
If your girl has male friends, you're basically in an open relationship. Look at your kids then look at them then yourself. 2 words: DNA. Test.
I've been searching for any talk of orgasms in the bible and can't find any. For all we know orgasms are demonic possessions - which would explain why women start actin crazy after. Play it safe: no more orgasms for women!
Don't let these women send you nudes with their hair and nails not done. They should respect you. Breasts are 100 but your head looks like a mop? Unacceptable
You humans that never comment. Just liking and retweeting in silence. You scare me. What are you demons up to?
I stopped tweeting for 14 days to try fake my death so my baby momma would believe it and I could runaway from paying child support. It didn't work. Her sister found me hiding under the bed. Long story - don't ask. Anyway I'm back. Did you miss me?
because someone your age mates are ahead of you in life doesn't mean your turn isn't coming. God is always on time. Jus keep working hard. One day you will die.
Since everyone is afraid to ask the real questions I will. Should ugly people be given the same rights as normal humans?
Ten Hag is set to fail. A good manager with faeces for players is dead in the water. Imagine all 12 disciples were Iscariots. Jesus woulda been nailed to a tree in chapter 1 
If Man Utd lose I will pleasure myself right after the final whistle 
Being an activist nowadays is easy. Jus put a Ukrainian flag next to your name. Boom you're a freedom fighter. Then log off and watch Russian spy movies on Netflix
Turning water into wine was okay. Nothing remarkable. Turning a 5 day working week into a 4 day weekend? That's amazing. He should've died every chapter in the book of Matthew
Is simping effective?
The secret to a successful relationship is in sex. The first time is the most crucial. Make sure you ejaculate within a minute. Set the standard at zero. If she stays, everyone's happy. Low expectations no disappointments. 2 min noodles for life.
The side chic doesn't complain. The side chic never has a headache. The side chic hates condoms. The side chic doesn't burn rice. The side chic swallows. The side chic doesn't wear granny panties to bed. The side chic is always available. Moral of the story?
I don't care how educated you are, how amazing your food tastes, how much money you have, how famous or pretty you are. There is always another woman out there with bigger bums worth cheating on you with.
After 4 mins you're no longer having sex, you're jus damaging your organs. Wear and tear isn't only applicable to car parts. Please.
So you people actually meet other people from twitter and have sexual intercourse? I thought we were all just here to tweet. This world is not my home
If you're going to simply manifest yourself into wealth, you might as well plant some money and water it once a week. Kill 2 birds with 1 idiot
What are you doing on Earth?
I always find men who choose a girlfriend based on her looks &amp; breasts, silly. Will those useless qualities raise your kids? You need to make sure she has big bums. Everyone knows that women with big bums have the best households
It's been 29 hrs, 16 mins and 53 secs since I gave up masturbation.  My hands are shaking, the air smells like a 637 farts, I keep hearing my testicles scream my name, I've lost sight in my left eye, penis is as hard as calculus and my teeth feel like tissue. Pray for me.
I have quit masturbation.
We all have something to hide. No matter how good you find a person to be, they are hiding something. Like me. I'm hiding my 9 inch penis. I've forgotten what the point of this tweet was. Thank you for reading
Social media is more of a disease than porn.
Are you alive or just living?
Back in the day you would tell your friends on a Tuesday, to meet up with you again on Friday at a certain time and place. And you just had to trust they'd show up. No phones. No calls. No sms. No whatsapp. No confirmation. Just trust.
Pastors will eat wives in the congregation and collect money from the husbands every Sunday. Life does not get any sweeter than that
You only start noticing things after ejaculation Suddenly her eyes are too far apart, you hate her cooking, her bums aren't the same size, her jokes aren't funny, her hands are too small, her voice sounds like misery. Moral of the story?
good men are nowhere to be found Good men are chillin in a clean house, after eatin a home-cooked meal, bout to get their testicles drained dry.
You think sleeping with multiple women makes you a “real man”? You've hammered 4 women in 2 weeks and you're proud of yourself? Real men can do 10 in a week. Catch up
Premature ejaculation is a serious genetic medical condition and not a laughing matter. Babies who are born prematurely because their dad was a premature ejaculator then grow up to be premature ejaculators. A cursed cycle
If you're goin through a tough time right now, always remember that it won't be like that forever. With God anything is possible. You might get hit by a bus tomorrow and be put outta your misery
Men don't care about salary or your education. You earn a lot and you have a phd? Good for you. That doesn't make you more appealing though. We only care about what's really important; bums and breasts
2 mins of sex is more than enough. It's actually too much. Bible is very clear on this. Scriptures say 1 day is like a thousand days to the Lord. Therefore 2 mins is… cross multiply and solve for x. More than enough
Don't go around tellin people that you have a side-chic. That's disgusting. Didn't your parents teach you  to never talk with food in your mouth? Pay attention
What do you hate about living on Earth?
In light of Man Utd's recent eviction from the UCL, I have decided to leave all worldly things behind and focus on my faith. I support only Heaven FC. I am team Jesus.
There's no football in heaven.
Bill Gates stepped down as CEO Jeff Bezos stepped down as CEO Even @jack stepped down as CEO Lucifer asked God to step down as CEO and..
You won't believe me but.. you can actually like both Messi and Ronaldo. It's totally legal.
Ronaldo is the problem.
When I get to heaven I need to chat with Mary Magdalene. 33 years on earth with superpowers and you die a virgin on a cross? She knows the truth
The loudest ones are usually the worst. If you want a real sex freak, go to church and pick the quietest looking woman there. You're welcome
Women will end a 13 year friendship because a friend cracked a joke about her weave. As a guy, if you're not making fun of your friends haircut.. are you even friends?
Father of fraudfraudpressing.
Lord help us 
I dreamt my sidechic said she was pregnant with a boy. Got home and my wife said she was pregnant with triplets. Moral of the story?  Man City 1 - 3 Man Utd Place your bets.
“he just made me feel loved again”  That's how women apologise for cheating
When you ask her out and she says I cant I just got out of a relationship if you listen closely you can almost hear the devil laughing as you get rejected.
I know a guy who quit his job after 14 years. Took all his savings and plowed them into his business venture. His wife divorced him. His family turned their backs. No one believed in him. Guess what? Today that guy is worth nothing and living on the streets
There was a time when the diary was an item used to record personal feelings and experiences. No need for that now. You can just log on Twitter and go through her page. It's all there
“When a woman is loved correctly, submission happens automatically” In layman's terms, if you have money she'll listen. Pay attention
“be grateful for what you have becoz other people don't have it” has always been a weird statement to me. I should be happy becoz other people are less fortunate? Borderline sadistic
Whenever I disappear for a few days, jus know that I'm busy with semen retention. Can't do it successfully while on twitter becoz of the unsolicited bums that are flooded on the timeline that would cause me to relapse.
Boom. The world is ending in 72 hrs. What would you spend the remaining time doing?
Missiles landing a few meters away and people are walking calm. Clear narration and cinematography is 100%. If this was a video of 2 drunk idiots fighting outside a club in Johannesburg, women would be screaming and the camera shaking like Mohammed Ali was holdin it 
I truly believe we're in a simulation. This world can't be real. 'Russia launches missiles into Ukrainian airport' is 2nd page to a 'Kanye releases documentary' headline. People aren't bothered. Yes the world is ending in 7hrs but who cares coz Rihanna is pregnant.
If I threw a 3 year old kid into a pool.. then jump in and saved him.. does that make me a saviour? Do I work in mysterious ways? Will you praise me or arrest me? Pay attention
Rubbish. I'm not watching the 2nd half. I'll wake up to a 2 - 1 victory tomorrow morning though. In Jesus name. Amen.
You saw the pictures in my phone. You heard the late night calls. You smelt her perfume on me. You even found her panty in the microwave. But you still stayed. Strong women are annoying. Please break up with me
I know a guy who tried to kill himself when he found out his grandfather was also his father. Yes. Read that again
The first impression is everything. If you meet her at a club and you buy her expensive drinks to impress, you have set the standard. You will need to stick by it. Pay attention
You're too invested in celebrities lives to be doing anything productive with your own. Busy dissecting and analysing their divorces and relationships on twitter. You're 26.
If your girlfriend doesn't cry every time it's time for her to go back home, she doesn't love you. Safe to say she hates you. In my humble opinion
I remember once running into a couple arguing in the street. I thought I was a hero so I went up to the guy and told him not to handle a woman like that. She turned on me and they both tried to beat me up. Moral of the story?
Aside from supporting Man Utd, what else stresses you?
I went to take a sh*t at 2-1. Before I could wipe my ass they had equalized. @ManUtd you make me sick. Bloody disease.
I'm not saying Big Brother fans are the solution to world peace. No. I'm saying if they all disappeared from the face of the Earth right now, the world would be a better place.
I'm not saying Big Brother fans can't count  to 10 without their brains overheating. No. I'm saying you could trade a pair of mangoes for their brains and make a loss.
I can't wait transgenders to start taking part in womens boxing and UFC. They'll break records and bones 
Aside from cutting my arms off, how do I quit masturbation?
The 3 things women want to know when they 1st meet you: 1. what your job is 2. what type of car you drive 3. if you live in your own apartment  Moral of the story? Money talks
I'd been at my girlfriend's place since valentines. It was amazing. You know how they say time flies when you're having fun? Well I missed the Man Utd game because I thought today was Tuesday. I'm tellin you women hate us
I wouldn't recommend a 3some to anyone. Overrated. There's jus too much goin on. It's like eatin and shittin simultaneously. This one's rectum is on your face and your penis is in the other one's throat. Demonic stuff
You achieve nothing when you confront your cheating partner. Especially in public where you cause a scene. It's not only embarrassing for you, it's pointless. You're not a skunk - have some dignity.
Valentines is over. Back to normal. Everyone back to lying and cheating please. If you've never cheated, you start tomorrow. If you have, cheat harder than you ever have before.
I knew a guy who tried kill himself on valentines when he found out his best friend was sleeping with his girl. He forgave her. They got married. Then he impregnated the housemaid. Happy ending
Job hopping can do more for your bank balance in 5 years than staying 10 years at the same company can. Pay attention
Please don't forget, your valentines gift for your girlfriend this year is penis. Nothing more nothing less. Jus pure penis. Pay back for all those socks &amp; ties. Give em a taste of their own medicine
The emotions you go through after finding out you've been cheated on? Pure comedy. Cake tastes like hair; the air smells like death; you'll even be wakin up at 2am jus to shake your head in disbelief
Might have something to do with the fact that he just turned 58 
I used to judge women who wouldn't leave their abusive husbands. Not anymore. I understand now. Man Utd has been choking me out since sir Alex left and yet I can't stay away. I love the pain.
Social media is a different type of influential. I'm officially desensitized to nude women. You won't scroll up or down twitter without seeing a naked body. Women in clothes turn me on now
Women are their own worst enemies. So you say you're sexually unsatisfied but him.. but you continue to fake orgasms? Sounds like madness
Man Utd can't resist conceding. They'll do everything in their power to not keep a clean sheet. I'm not angry. I'm not surprised. I'm tired
I was once abused. She burnt the rice then made me use a condom that very same night. I'm telling you women hate us.
People from biblical times weren't easy to impress. He turned water to booze, walked on water, turned 2 drumsticks to 5000 kfc buckets. And what did they do? Nailed him to a cross on the weekend. You gotta respect em.
People who watch Big Brother should consider donating their brains to science upon death. Surviving on earth with the IQ of mayonnaise needs to be studied. In my humble opinion
I'm on a 3 month detox. Gave up junk food in November. That was easy.  Then I gave up alcohol. Easy.  I tried to quit masturbation last week and I nearly died. Never again
If you can advertise, package and sell sex.. you're an instant millionaire. No other good or service has a better and longer track record. Sex was the first sin and the main ingredient to the oldest profession in the world.
A lot of homeless people I know are not dumb, crazy or stupid - they just don't wanna play the game. You know.. go to school, get into debt, work yourself into your 60's, retire with peanuts and die 4 years later. A pointless game
Firstly, thank you to my followers. After yeeears of free tweets.. please check out my clothing store. Buy and retweet - or whichever you can. Don't wait for me to die. Love me now at 
I often see people sayin you're too good-looking to be this dumb or such a shame a beauty with no brains A shame? So it only makes sense for uglies to be dumb? News flash: beautiful people have nothing between their ears but wax. It's in the bible
Semen retention? Basically unlawful imprisonment of minors? Isn't that child endangerment? Holding babies hostage against their will? That's kidnapping
Don't let your kids near anything Disney related. Beauty and the Beast? What a sick book. She has sexual relations with a dog in a suit jus because it was a multi-millionaire? What are you teaching your children? Disgusting
Cavani was offside but if you really think about it that doesn't matter. All that matters is that we love God and God loves us. Only Satanists think otherwise
Last minute winner on a Saturday from a Cavani assist and finish from Rashford is 97 x better than ejaculating. Change my mind
I don't wanna jinx it but Man Utd are playing like they actually train together and not remotely via zoom meetings.
As a father your job is to be present for your kids. Don't help them with homework, change nappies, talk to them or teach them anything. Just be present nothing more otherwise they'll be spoilt
For such a “bad” guy, Lucifer is awfully quiet. An introvert. Barely shows up in the bible either. Twice. Once he asked God for a promotion. The other time he was offering Jesus some kfc in the desert. Sounds like a cool dude
Women want a man who is wanted by every woman but doesn't entertain them. The scientific term for that type of wishful thinking is; buffoonery.
De Gea is really spoiling this team. Enough with the saves. Jus let those goals go in. Give Brentford the goals they deserve. Expose this squad for the frauds they are. Disgusting *spits*
When a woman says you're “emotionally unavailable” she means you haven't told her a secret she can use against you in an argument. Pay attention
Your partner is sentenced to prison for 5 years. Will you wait for them?
Do I think it's fair that I ejaculate in 47 seconds and she never achieves orgasm? No. But do I try my best to improve each and every time? Also no.
Soon as you start dating, tell her your birthday is in a month. If you get socks and/or vagina then you know not to waste your time on that stingy swamp rat.
Taking pictures of food on a date is ultimate swamp rat behaviour. You can't turn off being a wild beast for just 2 hrs? Disappointing, degenerate and disgusting
I was in the toilet takin a sh*t when they equalised. I sprinted to the lounge without wiping jus to confirm. My house smells like sewer now. Damn you @ManUtd. Damn you
To my fellow Utd fans, I will be starting an anonymous support group soon. A safe space for us to share our frustrations and pains. @ManUtd you will supply refreshments in the form of alcohol &amp; prostitutes. It's the least you can do. Swines
Manchester United is unbelievably disgusting. Jus when you get over the unplanned pregnancy, the Dr tells you it's twins. I'm about to have a stroke
Put a gun to Greenwood's head and tell him to pass the ball and he'll shoot. Every. Single. Time.
Lukaku is a vegetable that plays for farmers. Can't make this sh*t up
Lukaku is the true definition of “fake it till you make it” Jus big and clumsy. A blind elephant. That man can't hold balls for longer than 2 seconds. Be surprised if he even has testicles
“There is no man who does not meet a woman and immediately evaluate if he would like to fvck her or not” - (Ghandi, 1987)
What's the point of a therapist? They're expensive and offer nothing but conversation. I can get that.. plus more from a prostitute.. for way less. Pay attention
A virgin with someone experienced is already pain. But 2 virgins having sex is unimaginable. The blind leading the blind. It's like throwing ice cubes at the sun hoping to reach Jesus
When do men start lookin at women's butts? One minute I was an sweet 12 year old, next thing I couldn't walk passed a woman without looking back? Women took away my innocence. Be safe out there
I have done the research. And I have come to the scientifically backed conclusion that, being single is better than being in a relationship. Plus the only person to turn water into wine was single. Pay attention
It doesn't matter how long you've been dating, you should always be searchin for other opportunities. The best time to look for another job is when you have one. It's in the bible
I can understand the older generation gettin crooked by these forex and crypto “traders”. But you're 27 living in the digital world. You really believed he would triple your R7000 in 3 days? You deserve to be scammed
Showing one's confidence used to be as simple as giving a public speech. It's 2022 now. In order to show confidence you apparently have to get butt-naked on the internet. This world is not my home
Get yourself a side chic that's a Jehovah's Witness. They're the best: 1. you don't celebrate birthdays, xmas or valentines = money saved 2. they don't believe in hell = her and I sin in peace.. with no condom
“but everyone has a past” - (Hoes, 2022)
My girlfriend's birthday is coming up in 2 weeks. Can y'all please provide suggestions on how to fake my death
There's a certain no. 7 who shouldn't be playing a whole game. Even in bed… the older you get, the less rounds and minutes you can give out. It's science.
This was painful to watch. I'd rather witness my own circumcision with a blunt stone and no anaesthetic. @ManUtd why do thou hate me?
Getting cheated is a truly humbling experience. It brings you back to Earth with immediate effect. I would highly recommend cheating on anyone who has not been through it, in order to make this world a better place.
Sayin “huh?” gives you 3-4 seconds to think of a lie as they repeat the question
I'm a very traditional chap. So these demonic sex things you ladies do scare me. If you think you're gonna squirt on my bed and get away with it, think again. You're not a toddler. If you wanna pee, hit the toilet. Bloody swamp rat
You like bad boys. They're more exciting. Well you got one. He got you pregnant. Now he wants nothing to do with you. He's being bad.. as ordered. Now you're acting surprised. Where is the confusion?
The older you get, the less important certain events like NYE are. Don't get me wrong. I'll be drunk tonight. But I won't be surrounded by 800 other drunk animals and their affiliated sweat, Covid and most importantly.. farts.
It's extremely simple. The side chic is jus there to add the 28.74% your wife is missing. You don't wanna stress the wife too much because you love her, so you outsource the extra services required. Where is the confusion?
I watched the whole game. Jesus Christ at the wheel would not be able to save this team. If Cavani wasn't John 3:16 we'd be in the mud.
But Ole was the problem right?
I offered to take this woman to church on New Years and she called me boring. She wants us to go clubbing then come back and have condomless sex. Lord flood us again. I am a sinner. Sodom and Gomorrah us please.
That awkward moment when you realise that you posted that you'd get married in 2021 and there's only 4 business days left. Don't panic. Being ugly is not a sin.
I haven't received a single gift, money, nudes or even anyone wishing me a Merry Xmas from twitter. And yet everyday someone will DM me asking for a favour. Humans are parasites.
Moyes, Mourinho, LVG, Ole, Ralf. Man Utd really need to start using the gegenpressing tactic… ok men listen to me. The ladies have stopped reading. The best time to dump your short girlfriend was yesterday and the next best time is today. Spread the word. Merry Xmas.
I was washing the dishes and the cup broke and cut my thumb. I literally cannot hold anything. Basically I can't masturbate anymore. God appeared to Moses in a burning bush. He came to me in a broken cup. Amen
When you're sitting, listening to her explain how her ex's cheating affected her and you realise that she won't survive the tornado you're about to put her through.
1. You posted your bums. 2. I DM'd that I would like to have sexual intercourse with you.. and now you've blocked me.  You advertised a product and I am a potential client. Where is the confusion?
So if a 21 year old lady is under a 40 year old handsome man's picture dropping 🔥🔥 emojis.. it's perfectly ok. But if you switch it around... he's a vile sick twisted predator? Equality is as real as short women with kind hearts.
Women will push you to tell em why  exactly you're really breaking up. Then when do you tell her it's coz she's grown to the size of a jumping castle.. you're the bad guy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
Wisdom comes with age but not all elders are wise. Jus coz they were born in 1854 doesn't mean they're not giving you the world's most horrible advice. Be safe out there
No stronger connection than between a single woman and a married man. The attraction to unavailable men is strong in witches
“I can't believe you cheated on me with her” Why because she's not pretty?? So you're sayin ugly women don't deserve to be mistresses? Sounds like internalized uglophobia to me. Check yourself please. Everyone deserves love.
Yes we've been dating for 6 years. Yes I said I love you. Yes I said I'd marry you. But I met my soulmate last week and we're gettin married next month. Where is the confusion?
I know a guy who found out the kid he'd been raising for about 10 years was not his. He stayed. He lost his job during Covid. She left. Son is now reunited with his biological father.  Moral of the story?
I've seen people do some of the dumbest things unimaginable. But nothing tops a guy paying his girlfriend's tuition fees. As soon as she pens that final exam, she's out. What an expensive lesson to learn
Hey you. Yes you. You use money to attract and impress women because it's your only attribute. You're over compensating for lack of actual qualities. Jus kidding. You're broke.
“sorry my battery finished” “I fell asleep” “it was on silent” “i didn't see the call” Symptoms of cheating. Jus focus on God.
Jesus died for our sins, De Gea dives for our wins. Amen. 
I'm so tired of Earth already and I atleast get 7hrs of sleep a day here. How will I survive heaven then? Singing in church 24/7 continuously. Not toilet breaks or naps. Just singing.
Wearing a mask all day is the ultimate definition of uncomfortable. Now I know how women feel gettin home and throwing their bra off. Freedom
Snow White and the 7 dwarfs is the sickest thing I've ever read.  7 men were sex trafficking that girl. She overdosed on cocaine (snow) and fell into a coma then Prince Charming aka R Kelly had sex with her whilst she was unconscious, till she woke up? This world is truly sick.
Barca slowly turning into the Arsenal of Spain? I have to be honest. I love it.
You've known your best friend for 12 years. You've been dating the love of your life for 5 years. But leave them alone in a house together for a weekend? Sexual intercourse. Cold world.
Sex is not a competition. When will women realise this? Jus because I came, doesn't mean you have to as well. We are a team. If I win so do you. Where is the confusion?
The more you love a woman, the less she loves you. You treat her like a queen continuously? You're gonna bore her. It's called the law of diminishing returns. Impregnate other women and miss calls. She'll love you forever.
Would you want your friend to tell you if you're being cheated on?
I don't do hard-to-get or chasing or whatever high school games you're into. If I ask you out and you say no, you will never hear from me again. Hard to get... as if you're a female orgasm
I can't find my vaseline. I woke up with a bruised knee. 6 missed calls from my ex (is she pregnant??). Fred has scored a sexy goal. This day can't get anymore weird.
When women say they will submit to a man who “leads”, they're referring to money. You can inherit your millions, sit at home all day, never brush your teeth, bathe once a month and she'll submit.
Have you ever seen a guy that's recently been cheated on? Doesn't answer calls. He'd rather pee in bed than get up to the toilet. Has to be fed via tube. You'd swear he had malaria. This is the same guy that's been cheating since he could walk. This world.
So your man must protect, lead, plan, organize, provide, support, give you money.. but he's not allowed to cheat?? What type of a scam is this?
Instagram content must be stressful to create. Dress up. Make up. Tuck in tummy. Photoshop. Video editing. Posting continuous lies like that would drive me crazy
I'm really enjoying tinder. All those women that swipe right make my heart jump. Yes they're direct descendants of Shrek but at least something loves me ❤
Fred will never be benched. He can be having a horrible game losing possession but then he'll create chances for goals. I love to hate him.
I would rather my wife of 50 years cheated on me with my brother on my birthday with no condom on my bed than lose to Arsenal. This is an abomination
Man Utd 3 - 0 Ars
Nigerian movie storylines are amazing. “Beyoncé vs Ryu part II”. It'll be 3 hrs long about a woman who got cheated on, got depressed, bewitched her Dr, learned to play football in hospital, had a sex change, joined Arsenal and murdered her coach.
Women prefer being friends with men than women because we don't gossip or backbite. We don't envy how you look in heels. The problem? We want to eat you.
Women don't marry for money - they marry for love. The secret is to fall in love where there is money. Pay attention
The brain of an ostrich (the dumbest creature on earth) is so small you need a microscope to see it, making it the 2nd dumbest animal in existence after my ex.
2 - 0 = 2 2 - 1 = 1 Final score 1 - 1 Spot on prediction. 
Carrick is bold. Bench Ronaldo. Play Matic the whole game. And guess what? I love it. Waiting till Cavani returns. Bloody blue farmers got lucky.
Lukaku for Werner. One cow for another. Farmers.
Worst case: Chelsea 1 - 2 Man Utd Best case: Chelsea 0 - 2 Man Utd
Arsenal won, weekend is almost over,  brand new covid B134.5344 mutation from here, people that burn rice still exist and short women are free. This world is not my home.
I have $25 for anyone who can tell me why ugly people are always angry?
If you're funny you can get any woman you want. Married, beautiful, rich. Doesn't matter. Jus make her laugh. You'll be in there with no condom. I've said too much.
Women always want some profound reason for why you cheated. It's not deep. It's shallow. I was drunk. She has big buttocks and breasts. I don't even like her. I love you. The end.
I hate bumping into people from the ancient past. Askin me dumb ass questions like is it really you??  No it's not me. I'm a figment of your imagination. Bloody swamp rat
If you really really wanna impress her.. tell her you're married. Women can't resist the forbidden fruit.
My 15 year old nephew is celebrating 3 year anniversary with his girlfriend today. You're 27 and can't keep anyone interested for longer than 72 hrs
It's time. 
This is the part where Man Utd fans start sayin Carrick is the messiah. Watch. That train is never late.
Man Utd have more possession now that Martial is off because the only balls he can keep for longer than 3 seconds are attached to his body.
I've seen more chemistry between my hand and penis than this United team. Cum on Manchester!
I'm on day 5 of semen retention. If Man Utd win, I'm releasing my kids from testicular bondage.
“D'you know how many guys are after me?” If you hear that, terminate that relationship. That's a threat. She's sayin she has a bench full of superstars waiting to to be subbed in.
You'll ask your lady “baby what's wrong” all day and she'll keep sayin nothing. Then at 1am you get a long ass text: “I just think that..” “you wanna know what's crazy..” “I feel like you..”
When Watford scored the 4th goal I was suicidal. Luckily I was surrounded by friends and family for support. My name is Chinks and I'm a survivor #SurvivingManUtd
Hey @ManUtd  I don't think this is working anymore. We need to take a break. It's not you it's me. Hope you understand
Van de Beek played only one half.. and he's already shown that he deserves to start. His though balls? Visionary. Tackles? Effective. His passes? Pinpoint. Goals? Got that. Damn you Ole
Jesus died for our sins. De Gea dives for our wins. Amen.
If you're going to do things to impress others, you'll never be happy and they'll never be satisfied. That's why I'm a 2 minute man. My goal is the end. I'm selfish and I'm happy
If there's one thing the internet is full of, it's inconsistency. Y'all said you don't listen to R Kelly anymore.. but his music sales went up 500%? Somebody's lying
77% of secrets are revealed via pillow talk. That's why 36% of spies are women. Leaked information has brought down nations. You can't think straight right after ejaculation. Pay attention
Would you rather be: 1. a child forever (living under parents rule with no bills)  2. an adult forever (freedom but paying bills)
If you're askin her “did you cum?” .. then she didn't. The end.
Men will cheat with a lady they don't even like. It's just sex. Women will cheat with a man they wanna fall in love with.
Getting cheated on can help release your true potential. Eminem, Adele got cheated on and dropped the best albums of their lives. Cheat. You might create the next best artist.
Your soulmate sent you a DM but you didn't reply because you have 17,3k followers and he only has 297. This world is not my home.
Using your looks to get a man is the same as using a degree to get a job. The degree might get you the job but doesn't guarantee you won't get fired. Looks are not enough. Amen.
They say as you grow older, your ears and nose grow bigger. But not your penis. God must be a comedian. Has to be. No other explanation
When did you realize that being ugly was a curse?
Snoop cheated - wife stayed Clinton got his d!ck sucked - Hillary stayed Jada cheated - her wife (Will) stayed Dwayne Wade had a baby - she stayed Offset is still cheating - she's still there I put “🔥” under a girls pic - my gf blocked me
Women don't respect men who don't cheat. I've heard women say “he's too perfect” “he doesn't have that x-factor” Cheat. She will respect you. It's science.
Don't let these women shame you for being a 2 minute man. On a good day I reach the final destination in 26 seconds… what's stopping her from doing the same? We all have the same 24 hrs
This is too much. I'm not even on medical aid. Jus lay down like a starfish. Don't move. I'll be done in 3min17s. Max. 
Steve Jobs had 746 failed ideas Halle Berry slept in a homeless shelter Fabregas once played for Arsenal Abramovich was an orphan  I used to be 2min man now I can last up to 3mins17secs Failure is temporary. Keep going.
I can't believe I was trapped in another person for 9 months. I couldn't drink beer, watch Man Utd or masturbate. What was I even up to? Women scare me. They're literally kidnappers.
I remember reading a facebook post of a woman saying how she achieves her best orgasms when breastfeeding. After Ole fear women
As predicted. 
Ole needs to switch formation asap. Bailly and Lindelof should be playing up front. We can't waste top class strikers like this.
Man Utd 2 - 0 Man City
I have $75 for anyone who can tell me why we're on Earth? What's the point?
What is this talking stage nonsense? I meet you today, we have our date tomorrow and sexual intercourse right after. I don't have time to waste. I could be dead in 3 days. Learn to multi-task and talk with my testicles in your mouth then
Living all alone is so peaceful. I masturbate in the pantry, I'm walking around naked, I sleep in the kitchen, eat in the pantry, sh*t in the bedroom. I am free 24/7. Peace
Ole needs to go. But Ronaldo just won't stop delivering. I hate this team. But I love the goals. My name is Chinks and I'm confused. Ole you bloody witch
I am disgusted.
I want Ole gone but I want Man Utd to win. I'm basically Abraham - I don't want to kill my son but I want obey God. Help.
Ronaldo is different. He is abnormal. He is unlike. He is not the same. He is an outlier. I need him to stop scoring. I am disgusted
Cavani literally saves your career and you bench him? This type of stupidity reminds me of the time I didn't want kids, went in condom-less and she gave me twins. I'm disgusted
How'd you date someone who doesn't understand sarcasm? Must be embarrassing.
The uglier you are, the more money you'll need to attract women. The uglier she is, the more witchcraft she'll need to attract men.
If the topic isn't sex, violence or embarrassment.. social media won't really care. Pay attention.
I have $50 for anyone who can tell me what the “forbidden fruit” in the garden of Eden really was?  Best theory wins
Does simping even work? When you tell her what she wants to hear, do the panties slide off? Women are intelligent creatures. Agreeing with them won't get you vagina. It's in the bible.
Hello sir. Are you still there? Because my foreskin still is 
I sent Ole an email last week asking which God he serves. He hasn't responded yet. I don't care if that God is a feminist, I will bow down to that super power. #OleOut will never happen.
Cavani is the definition of class. The definition of education. The man has been running all game. That finish was the opposite of any orgasm I've ever had; cool, calm, collected.
Right now? I prefer Cavani over Ronaldo. Arsenal over Chris Rock. Lucifer over short women. Nike over adidas. Skin over condom. I've said too much.
Cavani is an all-in-one striker and defender. He should start and play all 90 mins today. If we still lose, I'll circumcise myself with my own teeth. Live on Instagram
Astrology for the weekend: Leo: your patience will pay off eventually! Gemini: chase your passion, you are close! Aries: you are smarter than you think!  If you're still reading this BS you're an idiot
Motivational Friday: Study hard. Work hard. Persevere. Fall - get up. Never give up.. and one day you will still die in debt. That's reality. Somebody cleans the toilets - the other is worth $197 billion. This is the world.
Some of these articles in womens magazines are ridiculous “99 ways to please him in bed! Number 47 might surprise you!” Men are simple creatures. Suck &amp; let him penetrate. That's 2. That's the end.
You can work at your craft for 15 years and be nothing. Social media can make someone else in your craft famous in seconds - even if they aren't talented. What a beautiful world
I just woke up from a nap. Dreamt we lost 5 zero to Liverpool. I can't eat. She sent me nudes - I hate them. I think I'm depressed. 5 zero? I'm depressed.
Chelsea won. Tomorrow is work. Weather is crazy. Liverpool clobbered us. Ladies and gentlemen, I am disgusted. That's jus the good news. Bad news? Ole is still at the wheel
Cavani doesn't deserve this.
Paul Scholes is a prophet? Can I get an amen 
3 nil down. To Liverpool. At home. At half time. I have no choice. Since crazy things are happening I might as well call my ex. I don't care
So far my predictions have been 3 for 3. All positive for Man Utd. I am already drinking to drown my sorrows. If you're a Red Devil. Please. Do the same.
We are losing. It's still hot. Can somebody please destroy these short things? No beer. Her phone is still off. Testicles are beyond capacity. I didn't go to church as promised. Is this karma? 
Do you ever think of life after death? If yes, what do you think?
Norwich isn't serious. 15 mins left. What's next? Mendy with the hatrick?
Chelsea is winning. It's 31 degrees celsius. Short women exist. I have no beer. Her phone is off. My testicles are full. If this is what hell will be like I'm going to church tomorrow
Watching short women suffer 
An ugly man with a beautiful wife means he's rich.  An ugly woman with a handsome husband means the condom broke, witchcraft is heavily involved or he's clinically blind.
When you're younger you're bound to make stupid decisions. Last week I decided I was done with alcohol. Today is Friday and I'm much wiser than I was Sunday. Here's to beers!
Not having sex before marriage is the true definition of living by faith. You don't know if I'm a 2-min man, my genitals are tiny, I have 3 testicles.. or a vagina. I have to go through a wedding only to find a borehole? Madness
The God of Moses freed the Israelites, protected Daniel in the lions den and turned water to wine. But the God of Ole is something else. He's been saved more times than a ms word document
Never doubt me. 
Call me crazy but I think we're going to win this game. In fact I am willing to bet my largest testicle we will. 1 ball for 3 goals.
I know I'm dreaming because we're 2-0 down against a team of farmers and electricians. I'm going to wake up soon. This is not real life.
1-0 down. Within 15 minutes. At home. Against a team I've never heard of. Is this what Arsenal fans go through? I can't live like this
Messi is a scientist. Set Mbappe up for failure. “I'd rather have 2 goals and no missed pen than you having a goal and a miss” Isaac Newton can't talk to Lionel about anything.
Mbappe is a farmer with quick legs. That's no secret.
I'm tired of being humble. It's time for me to shine. Tomorrow at 7am sharp I'm posting 4 pictures of my genitals. They are big. Chinks Kardashian.
I told my girlfriend how sad I was about the 3-2 Man Utd loss and she giggled. I told my side chic the same thing and she sent me nudes to ease the pain. Stop asking why men cheat.
Is my penis small? Am I short? Am I handsome? Do I bath everyday? Can I make her laugh? All of that doesn't matter when you have money. I promise.
Tell you everything so you can shout “that's why your father has 1 testicle!” when we're having an argument at KFC 
Nothing much to say today. Jus wanted to remind you that you're single because nobody wants you. As you were.
Jus found out my tweets end up as other peoples content on Instagram. You chaps are making money from my thoughts? You are eating women off my thoughts? No condom. This world.
Why are short women so evil?
Last time I mixed wine and vodka after a Man Utd loss.. I woke up at 2pm next day and the shower was running, my ex sleepin on my couch, her sister in my bed, used condom on the floor, 52 calls to my ex from 2007. Pray for me tonight.
When Man Utd loses I'm always tempted to cheat. Only my side chic understands the pain I'm goin through. The wife is only concerned about cooking and cleaning. Disgusting. What about me?
Cavani's a scientist. That's all I'm saying 
No one wants to say it so I will. It is okay to sub Ronaldo. He's a legend yes. But at 60 mins let's have 3 pair of younger legs up there.
I wanna join Squid Game with Ole 
Football is a game for immature people anyway. Plus blue is a terrible colour. Let's be honest.
I picked my phone up to tweet about Rashford's equaliser, looked up and we were down 3-2. What type of a world is this
“For Satan so hated the world, that he gave his only begotten Maguire, that whoever believeth in him should not win, but have everlasting loses”  - Ole 3:16
I have good news and bad news. The bad news is Sancho is not a £85m player. He's jus okay. The good news is we still have Rashford and Greenwood.
I've been using social media wrong. I log on, write something and leave. Just found out there are people here who DM each other, meet up and have sexual intercourse. No condom. This world.
📂 Relationships      📂 Dating short women           📂 Men who are happy                  ⚠️ This folder is empty
The more forbidden it is, the more they want it. Women. Eve never ate an apple - she slept with a virgin man. The “snake” is a metaphor for penis. She even convinced Adam to have a 3sum…
Goodnight to all the women with size 7+ feet. Only God loves you.
You date her for 3 years then when you break up she's tellin people you have a small d*ck. The jokes really do write themselves. 3 years.
Before I start dating a woman, I always make sure I meet her friends and family before I commit to her. My soulmate might be her sister
I'm afraid of church girls. I pulled out a condom and she said we're already covered by the blood of the lamb no need for extra protection. Church women scare me.
Cigarettes have multiple warning labels on them because they're dangerous and destroy lives. Yet short women don't even have a single label on them. This world.
Don't be fooled. Women don't like us, they jus use for our penises. The dildo can't pull her hair. The vibrator can't choke her near death. Pay attention
If you studied anything IT-related then your family basically thinks you can fix anything from tv's to iPhones
Back in the day your competition was only 4-5 other men. Then the internet happened. Now she has 17000 followers. 14116 are male. 14002 are sexier than you. 13987 have bigger penises. 13875 are richer. Moral of the story? She's not yours. It's jus your turn sir.
Living beyond your means to please other people has always been a weird phenomenon to me. I spend 3/4 of my salary on a bmw then go home and eat salt with bread? Madness
Gettin your partners name tattooed is not a symbol of love. It's a symptom of stupidity
Growing up ugly is one of life's greatest lessons. You learn to be humble, resilient and thick-skinned. Uglies are also nice with amazing personalities. Happy Tuesday to all the Shreks out there. We are blessed.
Sex really sells. You can be here tweeting funny, informative, educational and entertaining content for 13 years and only have 194 followers. Girl opens an account today, posts her bums tomorrow and has 27k followers the next day. This world.
When someone says “sssssshh” to me and I have to shut up I really feel like fighting them. To the death.
I miss God of the Old Testament. No nonsense policy. You withdrew and dropped your semen on the floor? Murdered. No trial nothing. People are fisting each other till their arm disappears and he's quiet? I miss Yahweh.
human nature by MJ might be the greatest song of all time. If they don't play it at my funeral, I am not coming.
Ole is problematic. As soon as we start screaming “Ole out Ole out”.. he goes on a 79 game unbeaten run. He's a witch doctor with a PhD in PE.
You're leading and in control then you sub Cavani at 56 mins because?? Ole was spotted having lunch with Abramovich so I'm not surprised 
Man Utd is annoying. The player you complain about is the one that scores. Now I'm happy &amp; angry. What's next? Fred with the hatrick?
Women are vanity vampires and men and sex slaves.  The one group wants eternal youth &amp; beauty the other will do anything to get laid. If I was Jesus I wouldn't come back either. Sick world.
Simps are born not made. But they can be cured. As with some diseases, you need to catch the signs and symptoms early in-order to cure it. Will Smith is beyond redemption. He's a stage 4 Simp. He should donate his brain to science so we can further study the severity of Simping.
This first time I got cheated on I finally understand pain. Started drinking heavy. Stopped eating. Barely sleeping. If my girlfriend wasn't there to support me I would've passed away
I honestly don't know why God continues to bless me so much. Who am I to deserve his grace like this? Farmers in blue lost plus a late Ronaldo winner? God is good all the..
I dunno what type of drugs Cavani is on but I need em. The man was there when Moses parted the seas but is pressing and jogging non-stop. He needs to start games.
Ole make the sub now. Cavani in. We score our 2nd and seal the win. Chelsea lose to Juve and the night is beautifully made.
De Gea is already the man of match. He's cut off more balls than castration. We'd be 3 down without him.
There was a time when social media was for chatting with strangers and connecting with friends. Now it's a diary. Yes please tell us how your boyfriend impregnated your mother on your dads birthday. Entertain us with your embarrassments
Chelsea losing is like Jesus dying for our sins - ''twas meant to be. Plus it makes everyone happy.
Her period is 3 hrs late and she's already picking names and schools. This world is not my home.
I don't believe in forgiving. I want revenge. I wanna take everything you have, including your wife. I wanna kick you when you're down. I want to injure you “Vengeance is mine, I will repay!” says the Lord
I'm a simple man. I like women, beer and watching Chelsea lose.
A lot of you know I'm a proud 2-minute man.  3 mins max. Last Saturday, I lasted close to 8 minutes. I was even sweating. I'm ashamed of myself.
When you're younger you think that having a lot of hoes is cool. Grow up. You need to realize that it's more important to have money and hoes.
First a traditional wedding. Then after that you have a white wedding. Colonizers really did a number on Africa. Gotta respect it
Friday I was drinking. Saturday I spent the whole day having condomless sexual intercourse. Man Utd won today. Just need Chelsea to lose and end the weekend in style.
De Gea please. I beg you.
Women just love recieving gifts. Even on events that don't make sense. what am I getting for gettin vaccinated? Blood clots. You're gettin blood clots.
Is fantasizing about someone else during sex, cheating?
The year is 2028. Men wear bras. Everyone wears makeup. Feminists walk around naked. Arsenal is in the 3rd division. Ugly people are part the LGBTQU+ community.
Don't believe people who say marriage is a scam. It's not. It's prison; no freedom to do as you please; masturbation reaches critical levels; funds are limited. Sound good? Go for it
It's not normal for a man to have one woman. It is unnatural. You're basically asking a hippo to fly. Furthermore, it's a sin. Please gentlemen, I wanna see you in heaven. Follow the Lords commands; 2 or more wives. Thank you
Too much competition up there. Lingard. Ronaldo. Cavani. Rashford. Martial. Just like side-chicks.. the more the merrier. Can I get an amen
So John 3:16 was about Ronaldo?  “whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal goals”
That goal was nasty. What the actual fvck. That's investment-banking-decimal-precision. Right to the point. Bruno.
Ronaldo with the hatrick and I'm cheating on my wife.
It was meant to be. 
Excuse me but are Newcastle trying to treat us like feminists by pushing a false narrative? I need toxic masculinity with immediate effect. 3 goals please. Nothing less
If Ronaldo scores, I'm masturbating until my arm hurts. I don't care what my penis complains about. Until. My. Arm. Hurts.
If Ronaldo scores I'm quitting masturbation. Save this tweet in your bank account.
I dunno bout you. But I love women. That's plural. Pay attention.
Imagine if twitter required people to have an IQ higher than a potatoes, to sign up. There'd be 0 tweets about Big Brother, astrology and Arsenal.
I love meeting women who are Big Brother fans. Coz I immediately know she's gonna be mine ❤ How can you fail? Her head is emptier than heaven. Easy pickings
If your girl has a male best friend.. he's f*cked, is f*ching or will f*ck. Either way, you're the clown.
When you find out your man is cheating, don't jus cry. Introspection first. Ask yourself what you're doing wrong. Why is that poor man forced to go outside? Fix yourself. Be accountable. Please.
Why do you drink alcohol?
Women will sell 3 sachets of herbal tea and start posting “they're praying on my downfall” Calm down Jeff Bezos
The idea of spending thousands on a wedding and honeymoon jus to start your lives out with negative balances... is madness.
Women will look you dead in the eyes and say I'm not ready for another relationship yet then get married next week. This world is not my home.
You cook. Take care of the kids. Make sure my testicles are always empty. You do it all. So why would I cheat on you? I don't know but I'll find a reason. I promise
You can measure the pain women go through in child birth. You can measure the pain from a heartbreak. You can measure the pain from losing your phone. The amount of pain Arsenal fans go through is immeasurable. They live in a circus. Clowning consistently is pure hurt.
Ronaldo has returned to Man Utd but you can't forgive and go back to your boyfriend because he cheated on you only 8 times? Women are not loyal. Disgusting
Who comes first in your life, wife or mother?
“I have a boyfriend” What am I supposed to do with that information? He's not your first one. So there were others before him. I'm tryna be the next one. Simple logic. Bloody swamp rat.
Not looking like your pictures should be an illegal offence punishable by 17 years in a maximum prison, in isolation living on one meal of frog soup a day. On Facebook you're A+ but in-person a swamp rat? Enough is enough. Jail these frauds.
“high value men don't chase women - we chase money, women chase us” - 29 year old man who's had the same toothbrush for 6 years
If your friend is cheating, keep quiet. If your friend's wife is cheating, keep quiet. Don't try be Captain Morals and save the day. Mind your business and keep quiet. One more thing; keep quiet.
OnlyFans is banning sexual content soon. Time to find a new home for you to demonstrate body positivity and show us how comfortable you are in your own skin
Picture of your ass; 288 likes.  Picture of your cleavage; 63 likes.  Picture of your face; 7 likes.  Post of your thoughts; 2 likes.  You can draw your own conclusions.
Women will give their man 147 2nd chances and still be posting “I know my worth” You are worthless.
If you catch your girl cheating, don't fight. Why fight? She let him put her ankles behind her ears. Fish swim. Birds fly. Hoes hoe. She's in her natural element. Respect that and move on.
In case you were wondering where I've been, I decided to quit twitter for as long as I could stop masturbating. As I type this, my testicles are as empty as Big Brother fans heads.
Don't underestimate the lengths women will go through to get some dick.  3 taxis, 9 trains, 2 bus rides, a 14km walk barefoot in the rain and no return transport money just to ride a penis. They make The Exodus look like child's play
Spoiling your woman and being used for money are 2 very different things.  The former is a show of affection the latter is transactional. You do one out of choice and the other if you wanna keep her. A man vs a client. Pay attention
The start of a new relationship is amazing. The new jokes, lingo, lust, activities, mystery. That's why people cheat. The excitement. You get tired of smelling your partners same ol farts. You want new stinks.
I'm a traditional and simple man. Doggystyle and missionary. That's more than enough. Not this car, shower, monkey, eating anus sex. Demonic nonsense. Just lie on your back. Don't move. I just need 120 seconds. Max.
I'm not saying Big Brother fans have the IQ of tomato sauce. No. I'm saying they could watch paint dry and be thoroughly entertained.
If there's 1 thing the bible taught me, it's that God rewards initiative. Take matters into your own hands. David kills man's wife for pu**y - becomes King.  All I'm saying is my neighbours wife is a diamond. He won't be missed.
Make sure it's wet enough. Then slow and steady strokes. Don't rush. It's not a race. Up down motion not horizontal. That's the recommended way to brush your teeth by dentists.
Sneezing can spread disease &amp; actually kill you, yet people will  say bless you for it. But an innocent fart and they'll look at you like you raped a rabbit. This world is not my home.
Believe it or not, before social media you actually had to be confident and physically walk up to a woman you liked. Now you can just send a DM and get a girlfriend. And yet somehow you're still single. Yes you. Talk about useless.
Please legalize prostitution. We're already paying for pu**y anyway. Let's skip the meal, corny jokes, transport and awkward silences. I have R25 cash. All I need is 2 minutes. Probably less.
Sometimes you should approach women just to test your skills. Pick ugly to medium-ugly women to practice on. A simple hi and quick compliment. Light conversation. Get her number. Never call. She's just the pre-season game gettin you in-shape for the league.
Okay so men are trash.  Men are made in the image of God. The woman came from a man's rib. So is it safe to say.. women are pieces of trash? I'm just reporting the gospel as it is written.
I don't understand why people fear the illuminati.  They offer you fame, money and success. All you have to do is drink baboon blood, dance naked around a fire and be actively involved in condom-less orgies monthly. That's a great deal.
The reason women hate the “tell me about yourself” question is because even they don't know who they are. Pay attention
Hints. Flirting. Mixed signals. That's all the work of cowards. Be direct. You like her. Say your piece. No beatin about the bush. Approaching a woman isn't a death sentence. This isn't North Korea.
You might wanna get to know your mother-in-law to be, before marriage. Forget looking like her - your girlfriend is most likely to act like her too when she's older. So If you don't like the mother.. I've said enough.
I drink with the aim of eventually getting drunk. I can't jus drink 2 beers and go home sober. That's like going to a prostitute for a hug.
Yes you should save. Yes you should invest. But don't forget to spoil yourself. Enjoy the fruits of your labour.  I spend 47.637% of my disposable income on prostitutes and STD medicine. The former keeps me from killing myself and the latter makes me wish I would.
My 3 factors for success: 3. Hard work  2. Strategy  1. Luck/connections  Successful people fail to mention #1. Connections can do wonders. Look at Lazarus; a useless bastard bum. But he got resurrected. Why? Simply because his bff was God's son.
“Men are the prize!” - a 29 year old guy who's been wearing the same torn underwear with faecal residue for 3 days straight
I'm sorry but I can't hold the pain in any longer. I know men aren't supposed to cry but today I woke up and the tears just started flowing. Guys, I miss the Euros. I can't eat. Barely sleeping. Help
I don't wanna live until I'm 94 or some ridiculous age. Soon as my pp stops working, I need God to call my number. A man without a penis is like a holiday on a Saturday. Useless
If you think whites are racist, wait till you learn about asians. They'll teach you the hard way. Free lessons.
I really do wonder if women sit down and think he's actually a great guy. Maybe I should stop cheating  I wonder.
No one more vile and malicious than English football fans. David Beckham went through hell in '98. He's white and there was no social media.. Saka Sancho Rashford vs IG twitter.
Don't get distracted. Southgate is the real devil here. Bringing in 2 players with a minute to go is beyond witchcraft. Man Utd players at that.
If 3 black players miss, England will unlock new levels of racism.
We're on the verge of an intense penalty shootout and you're worried about rich men and rooms 
I need 2 more goals from Italy.  1 for stealing this final from Denmark. The other for Elizabeth stealing jewels and gems from Africa. Bloody thieves
I might want Italy to win but I can't lie about the talent Sterling has. The man dives like no other. Amazing stuff
And please keep Sterling on. Let him keep making aimless runs that mount to nothing. Don't excuse the pun.
God is good.
Logical thinking is being happy for Captain Maguire and Professor Shaw but wanting England to lose. Needing England to lose. For the greater good.
When I was a younger man I was horrible at sex. I would rush through foreplay and jump straight to sex. Now I'm a professional. I skip foreplay.
I think God is a comedian. I mean how d'you give someone the ability to pleasure themselves then call it a sin? Why did you allow my hands to reach my penis then? Why not place my penis by my lower back where I can't reach it? What a joke.
I'm healthy and sexy. By God's grace my girlfriend finally got her period. Messi won Copa America. All that's left now is for England to lose tonight and 2021 is back on track.
Normal humans knew this years ago but Dr Professor Pastor Messi is now undoubtedly the greatest football player of all time on earth, hell and heaven. No debate
Whenever I feel like I'm falling in love, I have to verify if she truly loves me back. The easiest way is to cheat and see if she cries.  No tears = she hates me. Know your worth.
A lot of people keep sayin heaven will be boring. Lemme remind you Jesus' best friend was Mary Magdalene. There'll be prostitutes in heaven and no sickness? If that doesn't equal paradise to you, I dunno what does.
The people following 857 people with 2 followers are dangerous. They're here to inflict pain. You criticize their favourite singer and they go after your kids, looks, parents and dead dog.
Porn and rnb music gave women unrealistic expectations 1. I can't lick you up and down all night  2. I can't lift you for 6 minutes straight I'm not a mosquito and you weigh 4 buses
Going to cook spaghetti, order pizza and watch the Sopranos in prep of England's annihilation. The mafia better send the ref a picture of his family so long
In other words the people in the VAR room are English. Disgusting
Africans have zero respect for their elders. You pray to the colonizers god, speak the language and now support the team?? The ancestors are spinning in the mud
Arsenal does not deserve Saka. Ice-cream in a toilet bowl is sh*t.
I need Denmark to score 2 goals. Punish Southgate for his sins. Treating  Grealish like a side chic. Infact 3 goals because I need women &amp; children crying blood
Arsene Wenger's relationship with Arsenal reminds me of sex. He did his part as manager but his players were ass.  Same with women. You do your part but the verdict is the sex was horrible even though all she did was lie there like a log. Madness
I'm officially done watching porn. My eyes can't take it anymore. From here on out I'll only be listening to it. The sounds are enough. Me stop masturbation? Quitters don't win and winners don't quit
The year is 2037. There are 149 genders. China opened a new country in Africa. Looking at feminists is sexual harassment. Cardi B is President. Arsenal qualifies for UCL. I can't wait
These are the best matches. I'm not supporting either side. Don't care who dies or how. I just want death. The more violent the better
People who say Portugal's no. 7 is better than Messi have never kicked a ball a day in their lives. If they did, they were cows warming the bench
I can safely say that ugly women are the best humans to date. If you can look beyond their untalented face, the conversation is stimulating. Pretty girls are used to being entertained so they're naturally boring. 2/10. Would. Not. Recommend.
My issue with Facebook is that people who know you personally.. will take every post personally.  It was a joke man. Plus how was I supposed to know you really have 1 testicle?
Those of you tryna go overseas for these “teach English in China” jobs better be careful &amp; do due diligence. You land in Beijing, taken to a 5-star hotel for the night then wake up drugged in Uzbekistan in a dungeon missing a kidney, foreskin and 6 toes
Women's formula for gaining social media fame: 1. Post nudes 2. Talk about sex  3. Bash men Rinse repeat
I pride myself in being reliable. I'm always on time. Whether it's a date or a meeting. Even with sex. You can always rely on me to ejaculate precisely between 70 - 75 seconds. Every time. No time wasted.
Professor Luke Shaw. Phd in Crossiology. Class is in session
If you think Chelsea fans are a plague, God forbid England wins. Leprosy on Covid on steroids 
How to become a millionaire?  1. Find 20 idiots 2. Teach them how to become a millionaire 3. Charge them 5 grand each Rinse repeat.
That penalty was as clear as a Jehovahs Witness at the door with pamphlets. This might be why salamanders aren't hired to officiate 
Keeper saves. Opponent misses. And you still manage to lose? Revoke citizenship. Disgusting penalties
You have one set of people purposely grilling themselves in the sun to get darker skin.. and another set of people soaking in chemicals for lighter skin. This world is not my home
Gettin a girlfriend in primary school was a stressful process. Not only did she demand 10 reasons why you like her, she'd take 1-3 business days to make a decision. Prepared me for job hunting
A man is only as faithful as his options.  Your man hasn't cheated because nobody's tripping over themselves chasing him. He's unwanted; low quality; a factory reject; burnt rice; spoilt milk.  You should thank God your man is undesirable.
A lot of children's books are sick. Jack &amp; the beanstalk? Jack broke into the giants castle, stole a golden harp and goose, ran away then killed the giant? That's burglary, theft and murder. No jail time nothing. Disgusting
I think fraud is the best ability from Mbappe 
The drama in this match is Days of Our Lives on steroids. I won't be surprised if we find out Rodriguez is Deschamps biological son
Sir, Spain just scored an own goal in the knockout stages. Take a break from tellin us where men stay and watch some football 
You can really tell how much she loves you by the quality of the nudes. If you're gettin those closeup pics of a vagina, just know that you're nothing to her. The love is in the lighting, poses, angles and variety.
This is top level football not doggystyle 
Judging from this performance, Barcelona signed Depay to warm the bench. I've never seen someone with the ability to do so much nothing in my life. What a talent
That was a clear red card. That's like making me think I'm shooting blanks but you're actually on contraceptives. We need VAR in bedrooms
One way to prove to your girl that you truly love her; impregnate someone else and leave them for her. Abraham nearly sacrificed his son, you will sacrifice an entire family for her. True love. Can I please get an amen
You men need to have higher standards. You sleep with anything in a skirt. I don't play that game. If she can't even spell then she doesn't deserve the priceless luscious golden sceptre between my legs
Having 2 girlfriends doesn't make you a real man. It doesn't make you special in anyway. The strength of a man is not in having 2 women but 3 or more. 1 is pathetic, 2 is okay and 3 is the work of Kings. Pay attention
Thursday motivation: I got rejected for a job at Facebook  I got rejected for a job at Google So I started my own business. Worked 18 hrs a day for 2 years. Today I'm here to tell you my business failed. I applied to Google and got rejected again. The end.
Portugal score. France equalize. Hungary take lead. This group just has too much drama. I feel like I'm in a family whatsapp group
Mbappe 
I know I bring more to the table than just dick. I've seen their dildos. Those devices are Goliath to the David in my pants but the ladies still stick around. I'm not the prize, I'm the entire tournament. Pay attention
Apparently Southgate overheard Sancho calling him a PE teacher in the dressing room. It all makes sense now
The world does not care about men. A few errors &amp; you're stoned to death. No remorse If your man cheats why not find root cause? Offer comfort. Maybe he needs prayer. Or therapy. Women are drugs - maybe he needs to slowly quit. Reduce from 5 to 3 women a month? Help, don't judge
Go to interview.  Question asked: Given 2 fish and 5 loaves of bread, how would you solve world hunger, cure COVID and bring profits to our company without opening your mouth?  Actual job: Copy and paste this into excel and email it to me
I only watch porn with story lines. Why is the sink always broken? Does the hubby find out his wife is pregnant with stepsons child? Is the homemade ebony with a bubble butt a graduate? Only after I understand what's goin on will I ejaculate.
You have to be super bitter to wake up on Fathers day and start complaining about men. Zero correlation. That's like gettin a “i hate the way you dress, happy birthday anyway” message. Madness
1 of favourite stories in the bible is God commanding Ezekiel to lie down on his left side for 390 days, then his right for 40 days. During this time he was only allowed to eat bread which he baked over a fire of human faeces.
Since no one wants to address this sensitive topic, I will. Have any Arsenal players participated at the Euros? Is Arsenal the new pain? So sad
Portugal's no. 7 is scoring tap ins and you're calling them goals of the tournament. You sinners disgust me
Expose these French frauds. This isn't some farmers league. Tell Benzema Instagram likes don't translate to goals. Burn these French fries
These girls think a dinner date is grocery shopping. Busy ordering from the Family Meals section with no shame. I never complain though. I jus go to the toilet and never return
Women confuse me. If you don't cheat on her, she loses respect for you. If you cheat, she resents you. If you forgive her for cheating, she loses respect for you. If you don't forgive her, she resents you. We can't win.
Southgate must be a fan of bubble butts. That's the only logical reason I can think of for Sterling being on the pitch. Sick man
If you can find her social media page, you'll know 97.26% of what she likes &amp; thinks. This is a diary for women. Tricking a woman into thinkin you're soulmates has never been easier
Do you care that your girl fakes orgasms?
This match was Final material. Had everything. Counter attacks, own goal, offside goals and good ol' fashioned cannibalism
Your boyfriend just gave you an orgasm and you're thinkin about what  your ex would do 
That's why we put you through it. We know you can handle it. It's called women empowerment 
Don't be discouraged by the job search. I made it to the final stage of a 6-step interview. Flown out the country for the final interview. Business class. Hotel. Car. Tour of the company property.  That was 2 years ago. Still waiting to hear if I got the job or not
Some life advice for men; never sleep with the help. From co-worker to employee. Don't do it. The consequence is not worth that 4 second nut.
Something about the England team is jus off. It's star-studded but nothing special. You can clearly see Sterling's ass even with his shirt untucked but that's about it.
Your partner helps with your assignment and you get 37%. That relationship is an abomination and should be terminated with immediate effect. Nobody deserves waterheads for parents
Male &amp; female can be friends. The only thing required is for 1 of em to be ugly. But even then again, 5 glasses of wine can change that. Changed my mind. Male &amp; female can't be friends.
Why are you ugly?
When someone older tells you to spend your youth “having fun” just know that they're setting you up to be a bum. You'll spend your 20s fuxkin around, 30s in shambles, 40s in a mid life crisis and 50s giving horrible advice to 21 year olds.
I'm a firm believer in not having a large number of friends. Anything more than 5 and you're setting yourself up for betrayal. A certain somebody had 12 and ended up nailed to a wooden cross
Yes they treat themselves to nice things with their own money.. as well as ours. Gentlemen be super safe out there 
Kids with strict parents grew up to be thugs and harlots. Don't get me started on pastors kids. The definition of demons
The older you get the more you realise physical looks aren't as important. That's a shallow trait to want in a partner. That's why I'm a finansexual; I'm only attracted to women with money.
If you do this and suck his dick until he can't walk, he'll still crawl to another woman for more happiness. Men are beasts of the dark. Be safe 
If a guy likes your pic, he wants to have sex with you. If a girl likes your pic, she's already called headmasters to ask for spots for your future kids.
If you post sexual content, you will be sexualised. It's that simple. No one cares about your half-baked political &amp; socio-economic views. Show us your bums. Please and thank you.
Lower your standards and you'll be married in no time. Ugly people can confirm 
Women see the signs but choose to ignore them. “I can't believe he cheated on me” That man switched from Man Utd to City like it was nothing. Who d'you think you are?
Crazy how a woman will come into your life and think she automatically holds the top spot in your heart. You really think he loves you more than his barber? Madness
Your girl finds out you cheated and she starts crying. You're not gonna fight her? You're a coward? You won't fight for us? You quit? Your solution is tears? Women cease to amaze me
Using a dildo is not only cheating but a sin. The bible is very clear on this. Jonah 2:8. Good morning
One key to a happy relationship is being childish. It takes the edge off. Nobody likes Mr serious. Be kid-like. Pinch her bum, make funny faces, pee on the bed, tell her corny jokes, be spontaneous. Women love that
You think your friends care becoz they listen attentively when you share your problems but it jus makes em feel better about their own shitty situations. Your pain is their relief. Pay attention.
When a woman says “I built him” she means she had sex with him and bought him KFC twice.
Never pillow talk straight after sex. The blood that's s'posed to be in your head is only just returning from the penis. You can't think straight. Women know this. That's why they ask FBI questions. Ask Samson.
Men can't even sleep their way to the top because women are ungrateful &amp; selfish. I've been muffing your managerial pu**y for 3 years and you can't promote me? Not even a raise?
You never truly understand a hardship until you experience it. Please pray for me. I've spent the whole day asking why why why. Chelsea really won? The devil is alive
All these useless material things shall be left on Earth. There's no UEFA in heaven. Let's focus on what matters; Love and gospel. Good night.
Chelsea fans are a disease. I'm surprised God didn't include them in the plagues sent to Pharaoh.
You know you're a horrible striker when your best quality is running away from the ball 
Werner is the true definition of infertile. That man's wasted more balls than impotence.
My top 10 bible story? God gets beaten up by a guy with a dislocated hip. Jacob was attacked unprovoked by a random thug who wrestled him all night until Jacob held him in a choke hold, forcing God to admit it was him and bless Jacob.
You approach her, charm her, spoil her, make her laugh, wine &amp; dine her, compliment her, then when it's time… she pulls out a condom? Please put your clothes and leave. She clearly hates you.
Premature ejaculation is far from embarrassing. Imagine rubbing against each other's genitals for 27 mins and the result is just sweat. All that friction for zero. Room smells like burnt rice for nothing. Embarrassing
This is why men don't open up to women. You tell her your dog died and her solution is a blowjob. My testicles are fine. It's my heart that hurts 
It doesn't matter, at the end of the day we're all going to die anyway. Yellow is also an ugly colour.
De Gea. Dear Jesus son of Mary who is the mother of God.
John 3:16 was about Cavani. We are saved.
If Man Utd lose then Lucifer is definitely a fairytale. You nickname a team after someone who was cast out heaven for wanting to be ontop but the team is at the bottom? Nonsense
If the God of the Old Testament will be on duty on Judgement day, then we're all in trouble. He turned a woman into salt for looking back. What more you who's been masturbating half your life?
Nothing more disappointing than being attracted to a woman until she opens her mouth and you release she's intelligent. Marry the woman with the IQ of a shoe if you wanna be happy. In my humble opinion.
Be careful of imbeciles in church. You let your guard down becoz they're baptised. “Being saved doesn't fix the brain. When you're an idiot and you get saved, you're justa saved idiot” - J.D. Sumner
The bible says forgive him 70 times 7 times. Nowadays you cheat 6 times and she's already threatening to leave. You women will answer to the Lord on judgement day.
There are so many positives to Covid that we take for granted. You no longer run into family &amp; friends when you're with the ugly girlfriend. You meet indoors or she's wearing a mask. God really works in mysterious ways.
77 virgins is a horrible marketing strategy. If you've had a virgin then you know that 76 other headaches is not a good deal. Heaven is a place of peace not stress.
Visiting cousins is literally the oldest trick in the book to go cheat. Ask Joseph. Mary went to Elizabeth's for the holidays and came back carrying the saviour. Be safe out there.
I know a guy who married his best friends ex-wife. They had 2 kids together. A decade later he found out the kids were his best friends'. Moral of the story? Blood is thicker than water but semen is thicker than blood.
Condoms are the devils tools. It's in the bible.
Being afraid of approaching pretty women is silly. Most are harmless with little to nothing upstairs. If you shake a pretty woman's head, you can hear the water crash against the rocks. I'm just reporting the news.
Jus because he's a pastor doesn't mean he won't eat your girlfriend when she goes over to his place for prayer &amp; guidance. Man shall not live on bread alone.
I speak for all women when I say, they don't want expensive gifts. Luxurious trips, money, weaves &amp; iPhones is not what they want. It's the small things. Love and cooked food. That's all ❤
The bible says Lucifer was the sexiest chap alive. Women adored him and his gigs were always packed becoz of his majestic voice. Yet he still wanted to be president. Greed was born in the heavens 
The more you chase her, the more she'll resist. Instead, make her chase you. Grab her purse and run. Don't look back. Keep running. If she's serious about you, she'll catch up. If she doesn't, you have cash. Win win.
I didn't know church women are this evil. She said she'd pass by after church today. Been eating avocados, drinking redbull &amp; doin push-ups since 7pm for her. Even shaved my balls. Now her phone is off. I am disgusted.
I need everyone to be accountable and stop blaming everythin on the devil. Grow up. Did Lucifer make you burn the rice? Bloody swamp rat.
Date younger women at your own risk. It's sex in the morning. In the afternoon. Sex when it's cold. When it's hot. During Ramadan. After gym. Before work. After prayer. These younger rats will wear out your genitals.
Dear men with tiny penises, Trust me. Having a big one is overrated. Mine is gigantic. It's larger than life. Bigger than your dreams.  Anyway. I've forgotten what I wanted to say. Old age huge penis.
I know a guy who got hit by a car and had his leg amputated. His wife of 8 years left him 3 months later. He sunk into depression, lost custody of kids and last I heard he's homeless. Moral of the story? Look both ways before you cross the road.
I can't wait to be in heaven sitting at the feet of Jesus, listening to you heathens explain where in the bible it says sex was designed for orgasms and squirting. Which verse promotes genitals poking tonsils? I can't wait
If she asks for money in the talking stage, don't make a big deal about it. You're a man. A provider. Ask her for sex. That way you can block each other at the same time.
Cavani really reminds me of myself. I might be on the older side of life but I still deliver (in bed) better than these younger rats. Dear ladies.
You can tell a lot about a girl by what's in her purse. For example, if there aren't any condoms in there then she's ready to be a mother.
Since no one wants to address this serious issue, I will. Why is pregnant pu**y so delicious? There has to be a scientific explanation. And it's 6.3 times better when the baby isn't yours. God really works in mysterious ways.
I don't blame Peter for denying Jesus 3 times. Jesus nearly drowned him. He called Peter to walk on the sea then let him swallow water for 24 mins. Peter never forgot. I don't blame Peter
You're from East Africa sir. Men there get into relationships, disappear then their lifeless bodies turn up in septic tanks 60 days later. Your women won't kill me 
If you wanna see if she really loves you; don't spent money on her, impregnate another woman then go to jail for 5-7 years. If she's still around after, then maybe she deserves your love. In my humble opinion
You think you're hittin the spot because she squirted but turns out she's just too lazy to go to the toilet. This world is not my home
Someone just asked me “isn't he cute?” referring to their baby. I said yes. But now I fear I may be going to hell for that lie. The road to heaven is really tricky
Women invented cheating.  And having sex with a woman results in oestrogen transfer. Thus, men start cheating becoz of the rise in oestrogen and get more of it as they cheat. It's a vicious cycle. Depressing science.
If a baby stops crying because the mother threatened it with you.. you're definitely ugly. Babies have pure souls. They know a shrek when they see one
On the first date I take her out for some ice cream. If she bites the ice-cream, I immediately excuse myself to the toilet and never return. My kids won't be raised by a witch
If you wanna be happily married get yourself a former prostitute that has found the church. Prayers &amp; professional orgasms is an undefeated combo. Don't believe me? Ask Jesus about Magdalene
The more motivational and inspirational the messages, the harder the break-up was.
1 of the fastest ways to attract the girl you want, is for her to see your girlfriend. The prettier she is, the more she'll want you. Photoshop her if you must.
I am a very peaceful person. But if I get to heaven and I find there's no sex, I'm starting a petition for change of legislation. If it doesn't go through I'm starting a riot. Heaven with no sex is technically hell.
Since no one wants to address this issue, I will. When did ugly people start cheating like this? Back in the day dating an uglie guaranteed faithfulness. Nobody's safe now. I'm scared.
It's safer to steal your next partner from someone else than to get a single one.  Single = unwanted, unverified thus unreliable.  Now I'm not saying go out there and be a home-wrecker. I'm just reporting the news.
If you solely use money to impress her, you'll need to keep spending more of it to keep her. A true Finansexual uses money to attract, then other attributes to retain. Pay attention.
I'm not sure if rude women just end up in customer service.. or customer service makes them rude. The attitude you get from a teller/cashier would make you think the groceries come with a free blowjob &amp; uterus.
There is a secret to beating premature ejaculation. All you have to do is think of disgusting things like your neighbours yellow teeth, bills, Arsenal or people who burn rice. Works 100%.
You'll go on a date thinking you've met the love of your life only to find out via her Instagram page that she was just using you for a meal &amp; photoshoot. This world is not my home.
Church girls be like “I sent you pictures of my thighs and you still cheated on me. Am I not enough?”
All these flat-tummy teas and 3-day fasting programs won't help with getting rid of that fat. All scams. If you really wanna lose weight, just fall in love with the wrong person
I knew a young lady who thought her boyfriend was a cheater. So she had her friend “test” him. Started with flirty chats.. and ended in marriage. Lesson? Don't be afraid to leave your silly girlfriend for your soulmate
If you ever see a woman spend money on her man, just know 1 of 2 things: he has special powers or she's clinically insane. Women would rather pass away than spend their own cash.
I wish I was born in the olden days. 800 BC. No condoms. No pulling out. No DNA tests. No child support. No stress. Just pure ecstasy. That's why I can't wait to get to heaven.
If you want to find out if she's a liar, just ask how many guys she's slept with. The answer will be greater than 2 but less than 4. That's always their answer. Be safe out there.
Ladies, since we're living in a 50/50 society, please pack your own food when visiting your man. Bring water to replace when you flush. If not in the same room as him, use your candle. Condoms will be free.  Regards  Head of Sexual Management
I won't brag about our 3 -1 win today. No need. That's like marrying a woman who asks why Man Utd have never qualified for the World Cup then acting surprised when she burns the rice. It's an expected result.
If you don't believe in white privilege just remember that the Romans killed Jesus and then started the world's most profitable church in his name. Kill the son of God then accumulate $10 billion with 1.2 billion followers and counting. Respect.
Women get hurt by and choose the same kind of man over and over. If you wanna know what she likes, look at the men that keep breaking her heart. That's her type.
If you wanna see a demon, give a girl a proper orgasm. Her eyes rolling to the back of her head, shaking, toes curling and speaking in tongues. If that isn't the offspring of Lucifer, I dunno what is.
Do you know how evil you have be to wake up one day and just decide there should be 5 working days in a week? If I see that bastard in heaven I'm raising hell
She won't eat the brown part of a banana because it's ewww but she'll swallow your cum while lookin you dead in the eyes and call you daddy. This world is not my home.
Rule #17 social media: If your friends or followers are cheering you on to post something that they won't themselves.. you're probably doing something you'll regret. Pay attention.
The win is so much sweeter when you cum from behind. That's why I love doggystyle 
God answers prayers when you sacrifice. You don't have to burn a goat at the altar. I gave up sex without a condom this weekend and we won. You're welcome @ManUtd
Nothing bores a woman more than a faithful nice male. A bloody puppy. Ask any guy in a loving relationship with a happy &amp; satisfied woman. He has to constantly cheat to keep her excited. Tell me I'm lying
When I get to heaven I'm asking Moses what happened to him. 40 years walking to the land of milk &amp; honey then he died at the gate? I smell a crime. I wonder who murde- I've said too much.
I've been cheated on, robbed at gunpoint, farted on, called Mr 2 minutes, beaten up and stabbed.. but the most atrocious was walking into my own house to the smell of burnt rice. Disgusting.
Lois Lane only loved Clark back after she found out he was Superman. Same with Mary Jane and Peter Parker. Moral of the story? Get money and your superpower will be revealed. Rest is history
You know what you like in bed. Don't expect your partner to magically figure it out. Drop hints. If you like food play, jump into bed with scrambled eggs in your ass next time. Message received. Simple.
Imagine following the son of God around for years. Watching him turn water to vodka, walking on water, getting women to wipe their hair at his feet.. then selling him out for $15 and kfc. Judas is legend.
Ladies, having sex with a high value man for more than 300 seconds is an unreasonable abomination. Time is money. Either pick a sex machine living in poverty or a high earning man with 2 minutes to spare. No in-between.  Regards Head of Sexual Management
People with bad breath are tricky. You can't directly tell em without hurting their feelings. Gotta wait for the birthday and buy em $37 million worth of breath mints.
If you set your standards realistically, you wouldn't be single &amp; surviving on masturbation. Your asking price is higher than your actual value. You're a 39er. A 3 that thinks they're a 9.
The most undercover horny women are church women. They are always horny. If they're not singing gospel or praying they're riding a penis like Elijah did the chariot. I'm just reporting the news.
If you're afraid of approaching a woman sober, don't do it when you're drunk. You're a coward. Cowards don't deserve vagina. You deserve 49 years of masturbation on Earth and 693 years of it in Hell... In my humble opinion.
In your humble opinion, why do people cheat?
I go on dates to truly find out who you are. Tell me your hopes &amp; dreams. Your fears. What makes you smile? Explain to me why you expect anyone to marry you when you specialize in burning rice. I said explain.
I hate women that miss your signals. You do everything wrong to make her dump you but she just keeps on understanding. It's frustrating.
Hate or love em, you need to admire the work ethic of Asians. They move to a country. Living 12 in 1 bedroom. Work everyday. Rain or snow. Holidays incl. 2 years later they have shops on every corner. Then warehouses. Boom. Millionaires.
Don't be discouraged. There are women out there who don't care about your money, social status, penis, good looks or fame. You can find them at the cemetery.
You think you're special because your ex keeps trying to get back with you but it's actually because you're the easiest. You're the only ex that replies messages. Low hanging fruit. Pay attention.
With the amount of sin in this world, I wouldn't be surprised if someone out there has received instructions to build an ark. People burn rice and expect to see heaven. Flood us Lord.
Jacob married Leah. Then married her slave. He then married Leah's younger sister Rachel.. and her slave too. Moral of the story? The more women you have, the more God blesses you. Amen.
Looks fade away that's why only a kind heart matters - ugly people
I cheated on you. I asked God to forgive my sin and he did. I ask you for forgiveness and you're talkin about a divorce. So you think you're better than God?? Women scare me
Men are so predictable. That's why women post sexual content 24/7. They know you'll be there to follow, wag your tail and flap your tongue like a dog on heat. Bloody canine.
When the Bible said she lusted after her lovers whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose sperm was like that of horses I knew that gender was dangerous. Be safe.
Imagine meeting the perfect woman. Sense of humour, pretty, smart. But she just won't stop burning the rice. That is Man United. Disappointment when it counts the most. I am disgusted.
Men cheat 3 weeks into the relationship. Straight to the point. Women wait till y'all are happily married for 7 years. Why wait so long to be a demon? Satanists
I can't believe there are men who'll watch a lady pay half the bill on a date. I close my eyes or look away when she's paying.
Life is too short. Love yourself. Masturbation is an art of self-affection. Light candles - play RnB. Then beat your meat till the butchery calls an ambulance. I've said too much.
You should really do background checks on your partners. You want to spend the rest of your life with someone and all you know about them is the smell of their genitals? Don't be a swamp rat.
If you're dating an ugly woman there's a 98.274% chance she'll catch you cheating. They have nothing to do but be investigators. Date pretty women. They're too busy cheating to care what you're up to.
I think at this point.. attention might be more dangerous than money. Humans will do anything for 15 seconds of fame. Anything.
What's the best way to break up? Sms? Email? Face-to-face? Do you just vanish? etc?
Your boyfriend remembers who scored the UCL equalizer against AC Milan in 2005 but forgets your birthday every year. I've said too much.
Women: men are evil. They love violence. They don't care. They aren't considerate. They have no remorse.   Also women: 
I knew a guy in 2011 who paid for his girlfriends university fees. She graduated and broke up with him a few months after. He committed suicide. She's happily married with 2 kids now. Moral of the story? This world is not my home.
What d'you use when there's no toilet paper?
These women log on here and preach about mental health then log off and include their teeth in the blowjob process. Terrorists preaching about peace. Be safe out here.
I'm sure alot of women had no intentions of posting themselves naked when they joined social media. But they saw the amount of attention it gets them and couldn't resist. Moral of the story? Let's post our testicles.
Privacy in a relationship still needs to be respected. Just because we're dating it doesn't give you the license to pry in my business. You find out I'm cheating? I'm leaving you. You have no respect for privacy. Disgusting.
Date her for at least 13 years before talks of marriage. If she leaves before then, she obviously wasn't serious about you. Not worth the ring. Congrats. You dodged a bullet.
I hate pretentious women. Ordering salad and lemon water on a date then running home to eat half a horse with 12 slices of bread. I see you.
Your soulmate asked you out in 2016 and you said he wasn't tall enough. Now you're on your knees everyday annoying God about your loneliness. Satanism.
Just because he's a pastor doesn't mean his eyes won't land on your wife's wonderful assets when she walks over to give tithe. He's a man of God not blind.
The best time a company will treat you is during the interview process. If your interview experience is shit when they're supposed to be on their best behaviour.. imagine how it'll be when you walk through the door.
Thanos did what Abraham could not. He sacrificed his own for the greater good. All it took was a voice to stop Abraham the coward. It took 2 movies and 873 Avengers to try stop Thanos. Respect.
I like the God of the old testament. No nonsense policy. Turning women to salt, drowning people, killing first borns, sending bears to maul teens. Instill fear and gain respect.
Goodnight to all the people that'll be sleeping on a cold bed all alone tonight. Only God loves you. Amen.
Being the bigger person is overrated. Turn the other cheek? Keep quiet? Walk away? No sir. Not me. I'm a professional idiot. Let's see who can stoop the lowest.
If you died tomorrow, how many people would really care? 8 people? Maybe 10. Certainly not the 9500 followers you have. Pay attention.
They should just say that a possible side-effect of covid is penile dysfunction and the streets will only be filled with vagina people until further notice.
If you haven't cheated on your girl atleast once in 2 years she loses respect for you. Her get-togethers with friends are boring because she has no heartbreak stories. Do better.
Should've subbed Rashford instead. He's been running on E since first half. I wonder how much Abramovich paid Ole.
Instagram: where people log on, post a picture of an exquisite 5 star meal and wine then log off and eat dry bread with vinegar for supper. Pay attention.
The Bible says; what God gives, he can take away. But if you cheat on me and I take back the iPhone I bought you.. I'm a weirdo and a bad guy? These are double standard issues I'll be raising in heaven.
It takes a certain type of man to lead a woman and make her open to submisivness. Your underwear has holes and you're talking about head of the house. Madness.
The amount of effort he puts into hiding his cheating is directly proportional to how much he loves you. You found opened condom packs in his jeans? That man hates you.
You call yourself an accomplished woman but what have you done really? Have you ever made a man cry from sex? Exactly. You're a failure
Please don't DM in bio is elementary reverse psychology. No one is DMing you. We see you.
If you insult me first and I insult you back, you can't start crying how about I went too far. You threw mud I threw faeces back. When I play dirty I go all the way
I wonder what beautiful people say about us when they're in their homes.
I was gonna write a joke about Arsenal losing and Man Utd winning but it'd be silly. Making fun of a 1 year old for falling isn't funny because it's expected.
Just because he's a pastor doesn't mean always flood him with messages of verses. Send nudes. He's a man of God not a robot.
The thing is... [normal] men won't marry hoes but they'll definitely enjoy them. It makes sense though. You don't want to live with the mess - you want to paint the town orange but then go home to peace and quiet.
Send me 25 nudes so I can assess. Make sure your nails are painted. Lighting and positioning is essential. If you don't get a response within 2 weeks, please consider your application unsuccessful. 
I like normal sex. Penis in vagina on bed. The end. Not these demonic sex positions that need you to be on medical aid and have an ambulance on speed dial.
Please. Do not delete tweets. Don't you wanna be an educator? We wanna learn from your stupidity.
If you need to get half-naked to sell your music, you're trying to distract us from how garbage it is. Sex to our eyes. Faeces to our ears.
If you take twitter advice seriously, you definitely love living on the edge. These animals will tell you to hate your parents because they sent you to the shops and it'll get 800k likes. I'm scared of humans.
The older they are, the more you'll pay for the mistakes of their ex's.
Don't feel bad because you spent Valentines day alone. Being single isn't some curse. Remember it's not your fault that nobody wants you because you're ugly.
Ladies repeat after me; my son is not my Valentine. I am alone. My son is not my Valentine. I am alone.
I think the snake was a metaphor for her conscious. The fruit was Eve's vagina. Adam ate her and they felt ashamed afterwards because they didn't condomize. I'm 99.45% sure.
I could never date someone who's always late. Never on time? Disgusting. Punctuality is common decency. Waiting is painful. The only time it's acceptable to come late is during s- I've said too much.
Being naked online is the new confidence. Basically the rest of you with clothes on in your pictures have low self esteems. I don't make the rules. I'm just reporting the news.
You know that when are you coming to visit me line women claim to hate? They only hate it if they don't like you. You'll invite her for Bible study and she'll have condoms in her purse if she likes you. Scary.
The weekend is a scam. I mean Friday is a work day. Saturday is the day after a work day and Sunday is the day before the next work day. Madness.
Your business can be doing great for years and people won't support. They'll just watch from a distance. Soon as you slip up, they appear in numbers cheering your downfall. Demons.
Don't be acting surprised when you enjoyably ejaculate in a woman and she says she's pregnant 2 months later. You asked. Nature answered. Hello.
Working hard is overrated. People are born rich and some just get lucky. Shortcuts are highly recommended. If you have to french kiss anus to get there, do it. God understands. David killed a man to eat his wife.
Maybe you're wondering why I haven't said anything about the 9-0 win. I don't like bragging. I've got a big penis but I never talk about it. It's called humility. Try it sometimes.
When she sends you nudes without you asking. That excitement is inexplicable. Like kid iprning xmas gifts. You can't relate. The only thing women send you, is away.
If someone is charging you to teach you how to make millions.. you are the lesson. Pay attention.
If you made your move and she rejected you, there's absolutely no reason to still be following her. Block. Coz next she'll post her man and you'll have a heart attack.
You send her a DM professing your undying love and she's on the timeline going about her day like you don't exist. This world is not my home.
What you post on the internet will have negative consequences.. or maybe it won't. Just remember 3 things: the risk is yours to take; the internet never forgets; society is not so forgiving.
If you're turned on by these videos of dancing shapes in the dark then you're possessed by Lucifer himself and need to be exorcised, baptized and castrated. In my humble opinion.
If you can't get it with your looks or conversation, you're probably buying it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you're definitely buying it.
I saw Cavani run back to the centre half to win the ball back twice. Martial loses possession, doesn't bother chasing (as usual).. to which Sheffield scored. World class from the #9.
Ole waiting for the 94th minute to make a change. Genius.
The more friends you have, the greater the chances of you getting back-stabbed. It's in the Bible.
I don't appreciate these girls that tag their baboon boyfriends on my funny tweets talkin about this is you bbe🤣. No. It's not him. It's me. You love me.
4k followers and you couldn't get 1 to be with on Valentines? 0.00025%? Please donate your sexual organs to science. You're not using them. Embarrassing.
I just came here to say Bruno Fernandes is master class. He's really God's only son.
Covid is a conspiracy theory until it hits home.
If you're going more than 20 mins per round, you're a quantity over quality animal. Rubbing against each others organs for 47 mins until the room smells like burnt rubber is demonic.
Would you date someone who burns rice?
Don't log on twitter and start giving people life advice like you're some guru when you burn rice for a living. The basics are beating you up. Get your own life together first.
I know he's young but the game of hide N seek Greenwood is playing is amazing. I haven't seen that man all day.
The secret is wine &amp; dine her, dress well, be chivalrous, kind, exciting, attentive and funny. By the time she sees your 4cm organ, she can't run. She's fallen for you. Big heart &gt; small penis
These women want you to open up to but then after you're done revealing your hurtful secrets, the response is a blowjob. Ma'am. Wrong organ. The pain is in my heart.
I'm not saying Arsenal fans are insane. No. I'm saying.. supporting a bastardized team over &amp; over, knowing it'll lose requires psychiatric evaluation. Just to make sure you are not a danger to yourself &amp; others.
The 3rd thing I'm doing when I get to heaven is asking God what was done with all that tithe money. I wanna see all withdrawals, invoices &amp; receipts. Full audit. Someone must be held accountable.
When I'm on my deathbed, my last thought will be Rashford refusing to pass to Cavani on a clean counter attack. Disgusting.
These the matches you watch with the mistress. Favourite meal ready - blowjob at halftime - she understands formations. The wife be asking dumb questions like is this the final? Anyway Man Utd 2 - 1 LFC
I hate how women claim to love big d*cks until it shows up then they complain it's painful. Please don't jump in my mentions talkin about i hate that too when you know you have a cigarette attached to your testicles.
Women prefer it if you cheat on them with a beautiful girl. So next time, please respect your woman and choose someone prettier than her. That's all they ask.
*studies really hard for interview* interviewer: so tell me about yourself me: uhm.. when I was born I was very young
I can't believe you cheated on such a beautiful girl So only ugly humans can be justifiably cheated on? Uglies aren't allowed to cheat in peace? Sounds like body shaming to me. Ugly lives matter.
you're not my target market = I'm going to charge you an exorbitant amount of money for something normal just to make it seem like you're elite and buying something special
twitter: “the only thing your girl wants is love and affection”  Until you get a girlfriend and realize they're employed by Lucifer and actually want your love, passwords, money, energy, soul, food, time and semen.
Have you ever looked for something that was actually in your hand all along?
The best place to meet a single, financially independent woman is any type of home construction/hardware shop. If she had a man, he'd be there not her. And two, she's a homeowner. Pay attention.
If she cums quick, you did a great job as the man. If you cum quick, you're a joke. These are the double standard issues I'll be raising in heaven.
I'm going to write a book on the social, economic, unforgivable, baboonish and emotional long-term effects to society, of burning rice. It's a very deep topic.
Don't be afraid to approach a pretty girl if you're ugly. Women don't know what they want. Today it's Brad Pitt tomorrow it's a baboon like you. Just try your luck.
Imagine marrying someone and the only thing you ask of them is to cook rice. You provide the meat, salads, dessert. Just rice you ask.. and they burn it. That's basically ChelseaFC. One job. Can't do it.
He left me after he became successful If you ask what she did to help achieve his success, she'll tell you she was his peace. From rags to $12million and your contribution was peace.
If she spends her money on you, there's a 99.36% chance she loves you. Female humans would rather eat a glass sandwich than spend their own money.
Before you complain about your situation just remember that there's a family out there tonight eating brown rice because some swine burnt it.
I'm seeing alot of predictions on the timeline today. you will get money in 2021 you will be successful you will be healthy Can any one of you psychics tell me if United will win the league? It's important. Thanks.
I feel as though telling everyone about your long-term goals is just.putting yourself under unnecessary pressure. Why not just do it and show the results, if any? Anyway. That's just me.
Before we go into 2021, If I offended you at any point during the year I'd just like to take this chance to tell you that I don't care.
I'm a sucker for deep conversations with my love❤  I wanna know what makes you think it's okay to burn rice and expect anyone to marry you. Swine.
Having short-term memory is a pain. You walk to the bedroom to fetch something, get distracted along the way, get there, stare at the wall and return with nothing.
You never run into anyone you know when you're wearing your best outfit. But go out in torn shorts for 3 seconds? You meet your pastor, ex, guardian angel, boss, crush and neighbour. Satanism.
I really suck at cuddling ❤ 4 mins into it, I pretend to fall asleep until she actually does then I get up and steal money from her purse.
Goodnight to all my fellow Saints who didn't have sex this weekend. Especially on Jesus' birthday. The kingdom of heaven is ours and may God bless you financially.
You need a certain level of maturity to be in a successful relationship. Don't waste peoples time if you know you're still childish. 27 years old and still burning rice. Bloody swamp rat.
Each time I was about to start bragging, Leicester equalized. Cavani needs more minutes. 
A lot of you men will just choose a wife purely based on looks. If you think marrying some girl with a great ass and amazing tits will make you happy, you're absolutely right.
If your private parts could speak, what would they say?
Giving your girl money basically means you don't think she's smart enough to make her own. It's an insult. Women are not airheads. Stop giving them money. It offends them.
Men and women log on twitter, call each other trash.. then log off, have sexual intercourse with each other, reproduce and fill the Earth. Pay attention.
I hate women that get caught cheating then start crying. Literally 4 seconds ago you were about to squirt Victoria falls on the bed, now you're weeping the death of Lazarus. Madness.
If he gave you his phone password then just know that there's a 2nd phone somewhere. I'll leave your imagination to figure out what he does with it.
Martial misses way too many chances. He refuses to score. Must be allergic to happiness. Coz it should be 8-2 now.
McTominay chasing a hatrick. Lindelof up 1. It's organized chaos. But I'm not complaining 🙂 
Don't allow old people to disrepect you just because they're old. Being born 45 years before someone else doesn't give you the license to be an asshole. Moral of the story? Normalize beating up your grandparents.
What if, before you're allowed into heaven, we replay videos of everyone commiting their sins? We'll be in that queue for eternity watching men masturbating and women lying.
Arsenal fans should donate their brains to science so we can research how humans can make pain &amp; suffering look so easy.  It's an amazing ability.
The 2nd person I'm talking to when I get to heaven is Joseph. Your virgin wife tells you it's not your baby and you award her adultery with loyalty and love. Joseph is a pioneer. He invented simping.
If a man truly loves you he'll do everything in his God-given power to make sure you never ever ever find out he's cheating.
📂 Music  └📁 Gospel       └📁 T.D Jakes            └ 
My favourite position on the bed is her on her back, legs stretched out, with me next to her licking my finger everytime I flip through the pages of Corinthians and recite the good news to her.
96.46% of women will forgive a cheating partner. 98.9% of men will not. Moral of the story? Men love themselves.
Being obsessed with a celebrity is one thing. Being obsessed with their kids is something else. That's actually sick. You are ill.
Sharing this again so we never forget the failed assassination attempt on the GOAT 
We need simps in society. Without them the alpha male doesn't stand out. Can't appreciate toilet paper without faeces. Thank you simps. You're uselessness is appreciated.
I can never remember why I blocked someone but I trust my decision making process.
First person im talking to in heaven is Jonah. Goes out drinking, eating breakfast in brothels for 3 days comes home and tells the wife was trapped in a whale. Legend.
Women can go through the excruciating pain of child labour. But an innocent cockroach running across the room cripples them in fear. What a gender
Can't go 5 mins on this application without seeing someone's daughter's buttocks on display for no apparent reason. I've seen more ass than a toilet seat 
Your girl only tells you about the guys who approached her that she didn't like. You think it's a sign of loyalty but it's a tactic to keep you relaxed so she can cheat in peace. Pay attention.
Women can really gain 7k followers in 5 hours from posting 1 nude pic. But you can tweet amazing content for 8 years and have 700 followers. Pu**y is power. It's in the Bible. Ask Samson.
Enough. 
You are the average of your last 5 partners. So if those relationships were disasters, look in the mirror. You are your choices.
Rule #4 social media:  the internet never forgets. Yes they'll stop talking about the buffoonery you posted after 2 days.. but 3 years later someone still has screenshos. Beware of what you share.
In heaven there will be no pain or suffering. No football. No laughing. No alcohol. No sex. No sleeping. No Netflix. Just singing gospel &amp; worship. Forever. I can't wait.
Men come online and tell other men not to spend on women then log off and transform into a fully functional personal ATM. Pay attention.
Rule #7 social media: you don't have to comment on every single topic. It's better to be silent than to look foolish. If your thumbs are itching to type, stick them up your ass to keep busy. You're welcome.
I can post that I have cancer and my dog just died and there'll be someone in the replies promoting their hair business. This world is not my home.
If you cheat and she doesn't forgive you.. your sex game is nonsense. I'm not debating facts today.
Cavani is class. I'm still coming up with curse words for Martial. Give me time.
Bruno will shoot from his own half but yards out and he wants to be Mr Sharing Self-less Mother Theresa and feed the poor.
If VAR wasn't created for ManUtd, we'd have 10 men on the pitch. Fred has the yellow now so Pogba will be brought in to avoid a red then PSG will win 7-0. I'm disgusted.
False rape accusers should be sentenced the same as rapists. People never look at you the same - innocent or not. It'll follow you everywhere like a fart.
tweets are my own and do not reflect my employer That disclaimer won't save you from getting fired. Tweet stupid things win stupid prizes.
If you approach a woman and she isn't interested, walk away. Don't follow her. This isn't some romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts. That's harassment.  Good night.
The worst person you can take advice from on how to get a woman.. is a woman. be honest  just tell her you want sex  Horrible advice. Don't listen to women. They prefer lies. Lie.
I have a theory that people on twitter tend to be offensive &amp; provocative simply because irritated people are more likely to interact. Anything for some attention you don't get offline.
That awkward moment when you try kiss her but she says no it's too soon, so you call your witch Dr when you get home and she gets hits by a bus the next day, survives, marries the operating surgeon and you die of leprosy alone at age 97.
When a guy says he has haters, he posted the link to his song and got 3 downloads.
You're taking relationship &amp; life advice from 17 year olds on twitter and don't even question it just because they have 43k followers. Be safe out here
If you grew up afraid of girls, you're going to become the guy that uses money to grab a woman's attention. You don't have the skill or game to do it otherwise.
On twitter, women leave men who cheat on them immediately. In real life, we get 87 second chances. What a beautiful thing.
It doesn't really matter what you say to her.  You're only creepy if she doesn't like you. Women don't approach men.. but they choose them. Pay attention.
IQ is genetic. Leave him alone. It's not his fault. 
Manchester United wins UEFA 2-1.  Please save this message. I'm tweeting from the future. Put your life savings on it. You're welcome.
There's alone then there's lonely. Not everyone needs company to be fulfilled. I can spend weeks having long conversations, debates, laughs and fights by myself. I'm a hand full.
Whatever happened to real women who want to fix a man? You cheat 8469 times and she stays - to fix. By the time she realizes you're beyond redemption, you've impregnated half the town. I miss real women.
Are women that fake orgasms going to heaven? I mean they're doing it out of kindness. But they're lying. Anyway, I vote hell.
Job interviews are dishonesty contests. You lie about how qualified you are, they lie about about how great the job is. May the best liar win.
Simping is the art of sticking your head so far up a woman's ass you can chew her food, hoping she will reward you with a few slices of vagina for agreeing with her ridiculous opinion.. ..in my humble.
You give your woman everything and she'll still say you're emotionally unavailable because she's never seen you cry. Then if you do open up and breakup she'll tell people you were a bitch who was always crying. Can't win.
Alot of you see a tweet and don't find it offensive until you open it and find an angry mob of people offended. At which point you join in the fake outrage. Sheep.
It's actually women that ruin relationships with male friends. They get heartbroken, come visit you (with wine), start crying then boom.. her tongue is down your oesophagus. Women.
Alot of people think short women are evil witches possessed by dark spirits sent by Lucifer himself. I'm here to tell you that I am one of those people.
If you listened to twitter psychologists, you'd be convinced you were raised in an abusive home. You thought your childhood was awesome. But apparently you were abused coz you were made to wash the dishes.
Life is short. Try enjoy every moment. Cherish your loved ones. Be kind. Share what you can. Be respectful - to the rich &amp; poor. Love yourself. And most importantly never forget that you're single because you're ugly.
Rule #3 social media:  don't come here spewing your personal problems in hopes of getting sympathy and love. People will laugh at you and move on. In that order.
If she says the relationship had ups and downs that made it stronger she means she got cheated on and stayed. Pay attention
Never get involved in a breakup between 2 of your friends coz they'll get back together and turn on you.
This is unbelievable. Jehovahs Witnesses don't recognize birthdays. Not everything is about you. Respect your partners beliefs. He honestly deserves better 
When she says i like the woman I'm becoming she's fresh off a breakup that nearly killed her.
Humans love drama. And the spicier the story, the better. Doesn't matter if it's true or not - lies sell. Your ex said you have 3 testicles. That is what you'll trend for. You are mr triplestices. The end.
You can make fun of short people but you can't call anyone fat. And yet the latter can be controlled. What a world.
Bushiri is an amazing talent. It takes skill to steal money. But to do it in plain sight and have the very people you robbed.. protect you? Not Ronaldinho skill. This is turning water into wine typa stuff. Salute. Milk them dry sir.
They have not. These are the same women that will be under my tweets writing tell me it isn't so when they find out I'm dead. Bloody demons. 
People tend to forget that they won't live forever. Live your life to the fullest. Be kind. Be happy. Don't wait for their death to appreciate the people around you. Moral of the story? Send him nudes today.
Please don't lose yourself on the internet. You have no friends here. Today they love you.. until you make 1 mistake then boom... they want your head on a spike.
Back in the day you could safely date an ugly person knowing they can't cheat on you. They've evolved now. Ugly humans cheat more than uninvigilated exam students. Nobody's safe.
It's possible to be in a relationship but searching for your soulmate. Just passing time waiting for the opportunity. That's why men propose and wait 2 years. We need injury time to score the late winner.
People who hated you will be crying the loudest at your funeral so they can get VIP treatment and be served a large piece of meat with unlimited access to the coca-cola. This world is not my home.
When someone replies with K it basically means they don't want to talk to you further, don't respect you, hate you, don't care if you contract ebola and want to fight you to the death.. ...in my humble opinion.
Hey @ManUtd. Please sell that entire defense and use the money to pay my therapist's bills for all the pain you've caused. I'm tired.
Ladies, let me tell you something. This isn't 1942. Marriage won't change him. If he cheated before the ring, he'll do it after. A monkey in a suit.. is still a monkey. I've said too much.
They scream hoe is life in their early 20s then want a faithful God-fearing man 10 years later when their nipples are pointing at the ancestors. Pay attention.
I would never cheat on my girlfriend if she did everything for me. That's crazy. She loves me, cooks for me, cleans. Blowjobs whenever I ask. Buys me gifts. I have no reason to cheat.  - said no guy ever
Motivational speakers be like make your 9-5 the side hustle and make your side hustle the main hustle! then act like they just gave you $50 million
So tired of seeing women complain about how men cheat on them. You keep choosing these guys. Same type of guy = same result. If you go to bed with an itchy ass you'll wake up with smelly fingers. Everytime.
Assenal fans are in my mentions abusing me. Leave me alone. Bloody hooligans.
Deal. If we lose to Assenal tomorrow.. not only will I add the flag, I'll burn all my Man Utd shirts, underwear and condoms. 
The most dangerous animals on Earth are children. They can straight up ask you why you're ugly in a room full of people.. and all you can do is sit there and smile. Be safe around kids.
It's not a hoe phase. It's forever. Like a birth mark. You can hide it but it's a part of you. You can dye your hair blonde but your pubes are still black. I see you.
Nollywood &amp; bollywood should do a collaboration. A movie about dancing witches who eat jollof and Indian curry then get struck by lighting for stealing someone's husband.
Don't bother creating unique lines for each woman you approach. You're wasting time. Just use the same sh!t over and over. It'll eventually work. Same cv, multiple applications.
Maturity is finding out your boyfriend is cheating on you and confronting the mistress. Leave him out of it. Poor man was tempted by Satan.
I hate when people call and ask who am I talking to? No no no you called me. Who are you?? Need to be careful. I owe people money.
The best way to breakup is via email. You use bulletpoints, add attachments, diagrams, references and links to support your dissertation to dissolve the failed partnership.
Let's help each other. How do you deal with the pain of being ugly?
If you're dating a girl that visits her cousin on weekends often, you are not the only one. Pay attention.
Dickmatization is the muddled state in which a woman loses all sense, reasoning and logic due to the pleasures delivered by a penis. You can wake her up at 2am and tell her to wash the dishes with a toothpick.
When women say they'll only be submissive to a man with leadership qualities, they mean money. Acquire cash sir. Submitting to poverty is insanity.
I have so much respect for pastors. They get paid weekly, work 1 day a week, can make congregation eat grass, get blowjobs by marketing their semen as holy milk. The world's best entrepreneurs. By far.
If we lose to Chelsea today, I will gladly set my huge penis on fire. Yes, my descendants are on the line.
Women log on to twitter and tell other women not to cook and clean for men.. then log off and cook and clean for their man. Pay attention.
Don't be surprised by why your idols/celebrities haven't spoken against the atrocities happening in Africa. It doesn't align with their brand. Hence the silence. Pay attention.
I find it funny when people say social media is toxic No. Social media is just a platform. The people on it.. are toxic. You and me are poisonous - not twitter or instagram. Be accountable.
Stay away from people who get their personality from social media. Every month you're a new person. Can't trust a sewer rat that can't think for themselves.
Celebrities are not your friends in any shape, form or fashion. You are a cheque to them. You support their work - they make more money. That's where it starts - that's where it ends.
Ladies, I'm risking my life by leaking this info. If he doesn't take his socks off before sexual intercourse, he does not love you. You're welcome.
If you're living your life around but what will people think , remember that we all have a date with death. Trying to please humans is time wasting. Do what you want. Clock's ticking.
If the prayer is longer than 9 seconds, my mind will automatically start thinkin about wild things. And by wild things I mean interc- I've said too much.
You'll watch a crime documentary with a girl and the only thing she'll take away from it is how hot the serial killer is. Not surprising. Eve was attracted to a snake after all..
Forget starting a business together, never loan money to friends/family. They even have the balls to hang around you and say nothing about it. Disgusting
If you like her but not sure if you love her, just propose. That ring will keep her around for 2-3 years whilst you find your real soulma- I've said too much.
Please do thorough research on your partners. He got 23%'s all through high school and you're mad at your kids because they think 1+1=11? Your husband is the knuckle-head. The sins of the father..
The greatest things in life: 1. Sexual intercourse  2. Playstation 3. Sleep  I'm still debating the order of 1 and 2. It's close.
If twitter had a minimum IQ requirement in order for you to be able to tweet, this would be a ghost town.
Pastor: whenever you're feeling down just remember that there are people in worse situations than you  So I should find comfort in other people's misfortunes? That's.. madness.
Sending mixed signals/hints is the work of primary school students. You can't be 26 leaving breadcrumb trails. Be direct. Else you'll be 46 living with cats and sex toys.
LinkedIn is just as horrible as twitter. The liars are just working class crazies in suits. Straight after high school I applied for a job that required 13 years experience as CFO and got hired on the spot. Never be afraid to chase your dreams!
Imagine finding out your girlfriend tried to cheat on you but he rejected her 'cause she's ugly. That's twice the embarrassment.
Dating someone super religious is dealing with zero accountability. 0/10 I would not recommend. He beat you up? Lucifer made him do it. She cheated? Pray the demon away.
Don't tell friends/family about your business plans. It puts unnecessary pressure on you to succeed and not all of 'em want you to. Swamp rats in sheep's clothing.
At the Lobola negotiations, please don't be afraid to tell her uncles that she eats 8 slices of bread for breakfast.
I used to feel ashamed after masturbating. Unclean. A sinner. I feel nothing now. I'm a professional. I've said too much.
Real men know that having multiple girlfriends is only really fun in theory. Saving her as 'TV license number' on phone. Remembering lies. Changing clothes in the car. It's alot of admin.
You don't need to be smooth when approaching women if you have money. You can make monkey sounds and dance like a white girl.. she'll still tell her friends you're the most romantic animal the universe has ever produced.
If she says anything like i have alot of guys who want me you should leave. She's not lying. And if she has the balls &amp; cervix to tell you, she's going to fu- I've said too much.
Yesterday I had Indian chilli curry. Something I had no business doing. As a result, I have spent the entire afternoon on the toilet seat fighting for my life. Pray for me.
Guys please respect women. It's very simple; tell a girl you like her. If she says no, it's no. No need to be violent. Just contact me. She can be dealt with traditionally. She'll wake up with testicles growing out of her nose in 2-3 business days.
Being cheated on doesn't make you a clown. Being cheated, staying and telling the world about it? You might just be the Circus' main event.
Just contacted my lawyer. I'll be suing Maguire for public indecency, disorderly conduct, malpractice, recklessness, buffoonery, fraud and impersonation of a footballer.
They sent only the black man off. The referee and VAR is racist. I can't watch this nonsense.
So Maguire heads the ball to Kane and then pulls Shaw back when he tries to clear it? Maguire has to having an affair with Ole. No other explanation.
Legalize prostitution already. I should be able to order a McFeast, 2 milfs with pretty feet and a large coke on UberEats. It's damn near 2021.
Bollywood movies are unmatched. Man gets in a car accident with his wife. She dies. He gets out the car and starts dancing with the paramedics for 6 minutes.
You need to keep your girl on her toes. Be spontaneous. Don't be Mr boring sweet nice guy. Disappear for days. Ignore calls. Impregnate other women. Be unpredictable. Women love that.
When did you first realize you were dumb?
Did you know that you can make plans to meet and have sexual intercourse with a woman.. and when the time comes her phone is off? This world is not my home.
Your woman needs to know you're capable of cheating on her. She should be aware that other women want you. Nobody wants somebody nobody wants. You're not leftovers.
If she really likes you, where you take her on dates doesn't really matter. Gold-diggers give clear signs and so do women who are genuinely interested in you.
You miss 1 phone call from her in a long distance relationship and she'll be on facebook 34 seconds later explaining how evil men are &amp; how only God is faithful
Want a rough idea of who'll really care when you're dead? Turn your data off for a month. No social media. Note those who'll notice your absence. I promise.
You can predict anyone's behaviour using zodiac signs but couldn't see the last 7 guys that cheated on you coming from a mile away? The jokes truly write themselves
If you want to verify whether you're ugly send a message to an ugly person and if they don't respond, then it's official - you're a certified swamp rat.
Women can sleep through a tsunami but soon as you unlock your phone at 2am, just know that she's awake. Yes her eyes are closed. She's awake though. Be safe.
The only thing women want from men is attention, penis, bank card, trust, compassion, penis, passwords, love, jokes, cash, orgasms, time, gifts, compliments, prayers, money and penis. That's all. We need to do better guys. They're not asking for much.
Society doesn't really consider it abuse when a woman does it. She beat you up? You'll be laughed out the police station. We're apparently made of steel.
If she says you're crazy, all that's left from you is a tap in. Not even Danny Welbeck can miss from that distance. I think.
Clearly. 3 goals conceded in 30 minutes again West Brom? You're a joke. 
Silva can't run and Christensen is a rugby player. I hate the circus but these are professional clowns I love to watch. Lucky for Lampard, Abramovich is a patient man..
You've been harrasing me for months. Happy now? 
Physical vanity is a disease that hinders personality growth. You've been told you're goodlooking since you were 12 and now you have the personality of a toothbrush. That's why ugly homosapiens are the best conversationalists and people to hang with.
I'm waiting for Pogba to show me why I'm paying him £290,000 a week. He's lost more balls than testicular cancer.
People often ask me why I tweet about sexual intercourse alot. I like to talk about things I'm a master at. Anyway. Good morning.
Special goodnight to all the women with beautiful hearts &amp; toes. The kingdom of heaven is yours. It's in the Bible.
Single people are not attractive. Look, if no one wants you.. why should I? What do I gain from rescuing you from the depths of masturbation? Please explain.
Marry a woman that believes in that astrology crap, so when you're caught cheating you can blame it on your pisces moon and libra sun. Your sign made you impregnate 2 women. She'll understand.
Never make the assumption that introverts are quiet because they're shy/scared. We just don't want to talk.. to you.
Women are funny creatures. You invite her over for just the weekend and sure enough she shows up Friday.. with three 55kg suitcases.
One of my girlfriends made a joke about Man Utd losing tonight. I have since blocked her. I do not associate with and/or negotiate with terrorists.
People forget that we know them in real life. You don't eat 5 star meals everyday. You don't look like your avi. You don't have luxury items you brag about. You're a swamp rat like the rest of us. We see you.
If she doesn't buy you that ps5, she's basically giving you a license to cheat. She obviously doesn't love you. The end.
Never take the mistress to your house. Ever. They purposefully hide stuff that could get you in trouble. How d'you explain panties in the microwave?
If you think cooking, cleaning &amp; sucking his penis everyday can't guarantee a man loving you more and stopping him from cheating you're absolutely right.
They fake orgasms for 3 years straight then blame us for being sexually frustrated. If you're pretending to enjoy then how shoul- What a gender.
Mason daddy' Greenwood is busy inhaling laughing gas and getting his penis sucked Sahara desert dry. Bloody swine flu.
One day you'll log on twitter and see no tweets from me. Just know that Man Utd killed me. This bloody team. Crystal palace? I'm disgusted
You're charming, supply bombastic sex, handsome, funny and she still complains when you cheat? Get money. The noise will stop. I promise.
The universe needs to stop producing women with no ass. What's their purpose? To waste oxygen? They need to be rounded up, put on spaceships and sent off to Mars.   ..in my humble opinion.
1x1=1. Therefore in order to multiply and fill the Earth, 1x2 needs to occur. Women call it cheating but it's in the Bible.. and clearly in mathematics. Gen 1:28.
Samson? Destroyed by a woman. David? Seduced by a woman. You know what happened to Adam. Moral of the story? Masturbate.   ..in my humble opinion.
Women have backup boyfriends. Just waiting to be activated. 6 fully-fit penises sitting on the bench waiting to be subbed in as soon as you mess up. Be safe out there sirs. This world is not my home.
Ass over boobs. Forever.  Any man saying otherwise cannot be trusted, must be captured immediately, placed in a dark hole underground and tortured until the trumpets sound.   ..in my humble opinion.
Life:  Be born (without consent). Go to school (by force). Get a job (you hate). Start a family. Die. Such rubbish.
First they grab the entire duvet and leave you cold. Then they leave the loads of space on their side and damn near push you off the bed. Then have the audacity to ask if you slept well. What a gender.
Avoid making surprise visits to your partners house. You will see things that are not good for your heart. I promise.
Celebrity following and worship today is at an all-time high. I especially find it funny when christians do it. Is Exodus 20:3 a joke to you? I've said too much
If you're overly strict and cage your kids, they will grow up to be agents of chaos. Look at pastors kids. Those animals will even pay you to sin with them.
Your sex game is directly proportional to how many times she's willing to tolerate cheating. She's given him 93 chances for the 20th time because he makes those legs shake and scream like her house is on fire.  You looked at a girl once and she left you.
I like how Nigerian movie titles give the whole plot away:  the gospel singer who fought a lion, married her cousin and was bewitched by his uncle Part II
People share way too much personal info here. It's scary. Twitter has replaced diaries, confessional booths, bedrooms and toilets.
So you chaps let women who smell their bra's before they wear them, tell you how to be a real man? I've said too much
If he doesn't explicitly ask you to be his girlfriend, then you're making a dangerous assumption. That's how you end up in a 3 year relationship by yourself.
The difference in how women and men do their shopping, is the same way they cheat. Men just take whatever. Women? 4 hours just picking curtains. I've said too much.
If you decide to come to my house uninvited, I will watch my phone ring and peek at you through the curtain until you leave. Uncivilized swamp rat.
Real men cum quick. 87 seconds max. We have places to be, money to make and business deals to close. These brokies will spend 274 hours sweating on top of you. That's a sin. It's in the Bible.
I'm not getting into a relationship with a woman I can't trust. How will I know for sure you'll never tell my wife? I've said too much.
Your girl will see you buy Nike sneakers, play your friends ps4 and drink beer all year.. then take you on a picnic for your birthday. No Air Force 1s, no ps5 pre-order or castle lites. Just biscuits &amp; Liqui fruit. Satanism.
If you don't see me in heaven, it's going to be because I turned down the offer. Not sure about you but I don't find singing 'This Little Light of Mine' for eternity appealing
Goodnight to all the men that brag about raising their own children. Congratulations. You're the worlds tallest dwarf.
Porn titles are super descriptive.  Ebony girl with Biochemistry degree who still owes student loan gets banged by 24 year old homeless boxer who lost his job last week Tuesday but actually beat up Mike Tyson in 1984”
Social media hasn't made people dumber, it's just exposed the stupidity that's always been there. Free IQ x-ray vision
So you expect us to believe you spend 2hrs at gym everyday doing those squats but 46 seconds ontop and you retire? We really sacrificed our ribs for demons
One thing I've learnt through social media, is to never understimate the levels of stupidity people are capable of reaching just for 5 seconds of fame.
Fellas we're impregnating rich women all through the 202x's and retiring early. Our time is now. Spread the word and save a comrade.
Sending hi then keeping quiet is a mental illness. You are a danger to others and must be apprehended, incarcerated and thrown into a bowl of 100°C cooking oil for 2397 years.  ..in my humble opinion.
Signing a prenuptial agreement shouldn't be a problem. You said you love me.. not my money. If we get divorced, you only lose me - the thing you loved. Right? Right.
If Man City or Chelsea sign Messi, I'll circumcise myself with a butter knife. In Jesus name, amen.
Day 108 without vagina:   I can't feel my face. Pubic hair is grey &amp; falling off. Right arm is too heavy to move. Everything smells like death. Pray for me.
You know you've won the argument when they start correcting your grammar or spelling.
Most awkward/embarrassing moment you've ever been in?
In this hell you can innocently tweet i like vanilla icecream and someone will oppose you and say you're lying chocolate is the best your mother is a prostitute. Madness.
I do not see how you benefit anything by telling thousands of people you're a urinal.   Fathers please stay in your children's lives. 
Growing up you thought Tom was the bad guy. Turns out he was just doing his job and Jerry was the pest. Alot of you still think men cheat out of lust. Turns out we're actually just mass distributors of love. Perspective is everything.
If I get cheated on, I'm not telling anyone. I'm taking that defeat to the grave. Women? You cheat on her at 3:14am and the pastor knows by sunrise. It's on facebook by breakfast.
Sarah laughed when she overheard God's plan. God furiously asked what was funny. Sarah was so scared that she denied laughing. She fell pregnant with Isaac which means he who laughs''. God always gets the last laugh.
Crazy how you're more likely to get support from strangers than your own friends. They'll spend years talking about celebrities but ask them to promote your work for 2 minutes? Frowns. Swamp rat mentality.
Thanks for all the birthday wishes. If I didn't reply it's because I missed it - I'm not ignoring you. I appreciate you all and I'm off to get drunk now!
What the hell 😆 
Happy Birthday messages are cute but I can't enjoy them for long. Send me nudes. Or money. Both actually. Thank you in advance.
Double standards will always exist. Men who sleep with multiple women will be praised - women will be called wh*res. A man hitting back a woman who hit him first is an abuser - no questions asked. The list is endless.
Just say you're gay and go away. 
Nobody wants to say this because they're afraid of speaking the truth, so I'll do it. If you marry a non-Manchester United fan you're a lost soul and most likely going to hell. The end.
1. Rich 2. Funny 3. Goodlooking 4. Amazing sex  You will never find a man with all 4. Gods way of punishing you ladies for Eve's mistake.
You know growing up, girls didn't care if you were smart. Only the good looking airheads guys got the girls they wanted. Nerds are the high earners now. Shine my ugly Einstein brothers. Our time is now.
If you ever see me in public smiling walking with a short woman, please call 911 immediately. That's all I ask.
That awkward moment when you walk up to a girl to sweet talk her but she starts walking faster, then you walk faster to try catch up.. then she starts running so you start sprinting, she falls, hits her head, dies and now you're doing 40 years for manslaughter.
If Sevilla win after all those missed chances by Martial et al., I'm moving to Arsenal. I'd rather support a team that I know will lose than have my emotions toyed with like this.
Women don't revenge-cheat like normal people. They go overboard. They'll sleep with your father on your birthday in your mothers bed and name the baby after your best friend. Demons.
I know how to make millions but I rather teach you how to do it and charge you R2k a seminar because I'm so selfless - motivational speakers
When a woman says she has haters she's talking about her 2 friends who went to lunch and didn't invite her.
Women lie to protect themselves. Men lie to protect others - hence the numbers. The curse from the gift. It's in the Bible. 
After sex I like whispering romantic shit like hey you.. your Uber's waiting outside
What's the best compliment to give a woman?
That awkward moment when she's telling you how her ex hurt her and you're sitting there busy nodding, knowing very well you'll do worse.
Relationships aren't rehab centers for you to do your emotional healing.. infact you might make someone else sick. You need to heal before you jump on to other genitals.
Thoughts? 
Masturbation is better than sex. 
The problem with being ugly is if something goes missing around you, you're suspect #1. Guilty until proven innocent. No questions asked.
The food they cook is healthy. They're not statues in bed. The conversation is stimulating. And most importantly, they have money. Date fetuses at your own peril. 
Don't pillow talk. You're vulnerable. Blood in your penis is still making it's way back up to your head. You're not thinking straight. She knows this. That's why she starts digging for info. Look at what happened to Samson..
The short answer is no. The long answer is noooo. 
The ability to know which battles to fight - and which to leave. Underrated life skill.
If you want to be cheated on date someone who describe themselves as a free spirit. Their genitals are up for grabs. Literally.
The thing about stereotypes is that, they're actually mostly true. That's why they're stereotypes. Chinese are great at math. Short women are possessed. African men don't cheat. Ugly people like fighting etc
Oh my God. I woke up sexy again.
Sorry but I can't have sex with you. You're married and I won't be the one to break up a home. Marriage is sacred. Please put your clothes on and leave.  - said no man ever
Women have been using us as financial assets for centuries. It's time you joined. Chew her cash. Leave the relationship richer. Steal from her purse if you have to. Forget all that sapiosexual pansexual nonsense. I'm a finansexual. Money turns me on.
Being ugly and funny is a gift. You fly under the radar so women never see you coming. You're ugly so her defense forces are down. 1 minute it's hahahaa next thing sexual intercourse.
A girl that truly likes you will never outwardly ask you for money. They do that with clowns they don't mind losing.
If you ever go to a government office and there are multiple counters, I pray and hope you get a man to assist you. 9 outta 10 times the woman will be rude, unhelpful and belittle you.
She was pregnant before she met you. Run. 
Look. I would date a broke woman or one that burns rice. I might even risk my life and date a short demon. But never a Chelsea fan - that's where I draw the line.
The number of selfies you have to take before you get the perfect one is directly proportional to how ugly you are. The theory is brilliant.
If you ask how it ended and the reply is we both decided to break up ... that's the person that got dumped.
The person you really want is either in a relationship, lives far away or doesn't want you. 99.13% of the time it's the latter.
To appreciate celebrities' talent and to worship them are two very different things. One is recognition, the other is a mental illness.
You women need to be careful how you pick potential husbands. Stay away from animals that switch to a football team when they get bought up by a billionaire. You've been warned.
Women giving their men socks &amp; vagina on birthdays every year 
I'll pay you back next week - a person with no plans of paying you back this century
You will never truly understand how disgusting crime is until you're a victim. I promise.
David wanted to marry a woman, but her father (King Saul) wanted 100 foreskins of his enemies as dowry. So David brought him 200 foreskins. Which is understandable. Because foreskins.
Don't automatically assume advice from older people is golden. Wisdom may come with age but T's &amp; C's apply. Some fossils are just loud mouths.
You people on twitter always have an opinion on everything. Since you're experts on all things, tell me why you always get cheated on.
You know how they say never mix business with pleasure? Well that's exactly what marriage is. I'm just reporting the news
Masturbation is a sin? So heaven will only have women and babies. Unbelievable.
97.296% of the time, If a woman calls you a real man you're most probably doing something to her benefit and your loss.
People that don't drink alcohol tend to be weird. There's always a loose screw or 3 up there. Stay far away from them.
Don't marry a submissive traditional girl. Marry a feminist go-getter. She goes out and makes the cash while you stay home, drinking  beer, taking care of the kids with the sexy 23 year old nanny. Win win.
I value trust over anything else when I get into a relationship with a woman. I need to know I can trust that you'll never tell my wife. I've said too much.
The same women that broke our hearts in grade 2 are the ones asking why we're emotionally unavailable now. The audacity. You created this monster you demon.
Pastors wearing masks will never not be funny to me. All this time I thought they were protected by the blood of the lamb. I have been bamboozled.
I'm telling you, the sooner you accept your ugly face the simpler your life becomes. Once you beat vanity, you can conquer anything.
The equivalent to a woman posting herself half-naked, is a man posting his financial assets. The objective is the same. Anyway.
Men were blessed with extraordinarily large hearts. And yet when we try spread our love, society calls it cheating. The curse from the gift.
Cheaters guilt. Ask him who he's banging in those dreams that keep waking him up 
Your friend tells you they're getting married and your first question is to who? Either you're not really a friend or somebody's a hoe. My money's on the latter.
Wait. So Mary went to visit her pregnant cousin Elizabeth and husband Zechariah. She then left 3 months later pregnant with Jesus. Zechariah Zechariah Zechariah...
If you pay a musician before he sings, he sounds terrible. 
You pick her up, have a romantic dinner, take pictures, enjoy laughs, drop her off.. check her facebook and find your face covered with a 🤪 emoji. Women.
People on twitter just love fighting. The tweet is about porn but you'll somehow find 2 imbeciles in the comment section arguing about John the baptist.
David, you're making way too much sense but you're trying to reason with a brick wall. Save yourself the trouble. 
Ever noticed how women smile to each others' faces and give fake compliments then as soon as one leaves.. they gossip about her? Why do women hate each other?
When a guy starts cheating his routine changes; starts wearing matching socks, bathing everyday, going to gym, working late. When a woman starts cheating; nothing changes.
Companies that still make people write cover letters are ridiculous beyond Jada Pinkett. They don't even read these love letters. All you need to know is in the CV. 
The same way a woman will rarely marry down financially, a man will rarely forgive cheating. I'm just reporting the news.
Ladies, did you know that if your man buys you a great gift that you thought he could never think of.. his mistress probably picked it out for y- I've said too much.
“Sapiosexual” but 98.73% of the time she'll choose the guy with money over your sexy brains. Your IQ won't buy weaves &amp; makeup.
If you got cheated on during the lockdown and stayed, you are the circus main event. The law couldn't stop them, so who the hell do you think you are?
Women might not get this but nudes with some parts hidden are 850x better than the ones with everything on display. Just show me an armpit, my imagination will handle the rest.
Tomorrow at 7am I'm posting myself in shorts with my testicles showing. People need to know that I'm also confident &amp; comfortable in my own skin 
You know you're a sexy dumbass if you're popular on instagram and non-existent on twitter.
If you're interested in a girl and she tells you she prefers male friends to female ones because they have less drama, abort mission. That's a village bicycle.
We live in a world where women cheat back. This generation is truly sick. Anyway goodmorning. I woke up sexy again.
You could have a penis longer than the last 20 minutes at work but when you breakup, she's telling everyone you were Ant-man. Then they wonder why men never open up to them.
You know the devil is alive when you send her your nudes and she stops replying.
Load shedding ends. I turn on the TV. Southampton scores before I can even put the remote down. If that doesn't prove existence of Satan I don't know what does.
If you're Mr nice guy, she'll lose interest in you. You're boring. No x-factor. Women want a kind criminal with the heart of a saint, voice of an angel and unpredictability of the economy.
I just watched a video of a 16 year old proposing to his girlfriend. You're 27 and still burning rice. Lord help you.
If you were to tell people that God told you to kill your son then changed his mind just when you about to... would you be praised or put in a mental facility?
Who died and made you Minister of disentangling 
The secret to being a successful cheater, is to never mess around with someone who has nothing to lose. 
If you have Jada Pinkett typa vagina, stay far away from me. That's a weapon of mass destruction.
You think getting cheated on is painful?   Wait till you put on your earphones and only one side is working. Torture.
If your girlfriend has the money in the relationship, please prepare yourself for emotional abuse. Half a mistake and she'll embarass you. Shouting dont forget i buy your undies at a family party.
2 things I've never seen; A spaceship and a tall girl with a fat ass. There are plenty conspiracy theories about their existence but zero evidence.
I can't believe he cheated on me   - a girl that burns rice
If Man Utd score another goal, I'm rewarding myself by getting another girlfriend. In Jesus' name, amen.
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing women that drinking tea advertised by instagram models will give them a flat tummy.

A man given good looks will eat your girl. A man given money will eat the whole village. 
If you meet a girl and within a month she says she's pregnant.. you might wanna double check if it's really yours. It could just be the pregnancy chose you.

Ladies, I want to take this opportunity to appreciate you. These guys won't show their gratitude so I want to personally thank you for faking orgasms. Oscar-worthy stuff. Keep it up.
When women are in love they ignore obvious signs. i found a used condom in the back seat should I be worried? 2 months later you wanna act all surprised because you found out your boyfriend is getting married Saturday. Silly rabbit.
You can't just speak it into existence or manifest it and think it'll just happen. You have to put in work. Day-dreaming and typing 'amen' under pictures of money will get you nowhere fast.
Don't worry about your height, the size of your penis, how long you last, your handsomeness, your etc. It doesn't matter. Just get money. Her standards will disappear.
One more goal from Manchester United and I'm adding the Ugandan flag to my name. 6 - 2 please.

Once you tattoo your partner on you in any shape or form, you have officially reached the ultimate level of stupidity. Donate your brain to science for research.

A great thing about being ugly is when you finally make it, no one can say you slept your way to the top. Goodnight.
Twitter is the devil. I logged on to tweet something but then I saw a video of babies crying, then watched Man Utd highlights, next thing I'm on BBWs - spent an enjoyable 7 minutes there. Now I've forgotten what I wanted to post.
I realized the relationship was over when we were watching football and she asked why the striker doesn't just remain behind with the keeper and wait for the ball.
One of the most important keys to success/opportunity, are your connections &amp; relationships. Your qualifications &amp; experience are cute. But they can't compete with having an uncle who knows the CEO. Not on this Earth.
So my genitals going down your throat is less intimate than my tongue? The end is truly near. 
Masturbation 😂 
If you use money to attract women, you'd better always have it. Because if it runs out, she will too.
So women just willingly choose a life of investigating, confronting mistresses, crying and staying then. Interesting. 
Ladies, did you know that your mans female friends are the most dangerous? They're the ones constantly trying to hook him up with women who suit him better than you do. I've said too much.

Funny how if you make a joke about fat people - the fat people around will be offended. But if you make fun of ugly people - the ugly ones will laugh. Know why? Because ignorance is bliss.
Women are funny beasts. They'll spend 40 days and 40 nights trying to find out who you're cheating with just so they can fight her and still stay with you. Keep it up ladies. We love the energy.
please hook me up with your friend No no. Do it yourself. I don't want to be part of your hookup, honeymoon phase or your break up. Leave me out of your soapie.

Love is really power. After spending the day with my soulmate I feel energized. I'm recharged with joy. Then the drive back home to the wife takes it all away. I am weak again.
Men who've dated short women should be on Fear Factor. If you can survive demons, you can win that $50k easily.
He who places genitals in the mouth of another is an abomination and should be stoned to death.  The Bible is very clear on this one. 
As soon as I hear the Pastor say so in conclusion Im suddenly wide awake again.
I feel like if Jesus just made one guest appearance people would follow him. He sent his son Messi but that's not enough. Appear from the sky and drop ps5's. He'd gain 3.7 billion faithful followers overnight. Guaranteed.
Women will speak highly of you to their friends then be all angry when you eat them. You told them I was a fully charged sex machine sent from the future and you thought they wouldn't want a taste? You advertised me. I'm the victim.
Ladies, don't flirt too aggressively with your man. By the time you reply ok what time? his penis is calculus hard. By the time you say im on my way he's ejaculated. I've said too much. Goodmorning.
Apparently my hand and genitals were meant to be. In the wise words of Sir Albert Einstein; thou shalt not hate the player but the game 
Maybe it's time I hung up my gloves. I've been destroying my genitals for decades. Might be the gift from the curse.. 
If Manchester Utd loses today, I'm done with masturbation. I promise.
If you don't understand sarcasm, your life on this Earth will be hard. People will be dancing circles around you and you won't even know it.
You're not afraid of women? I remembered a guy I once knew who paid for his girlfriend's tertiary fees. All 6 years. She left him months after graduating with her masters. He lost his mind. Literally. He was in a mental asylum for a while. Be safe.
I don't understand why men with tiny genitals seek out women with big bums. Your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Just stay in your size bracket and avoid wasting her time. Trust me.
Women will your girlfriend will kill me you to death instead of just saying they like you. Bloody cowards.

True. But Jefe, I also deserve a big penis but God doesn't operate like that. You work with what you have. 
Come with 2 bottles of premium whiskey and a beautiful Kenyan woman otherwise I am not answering the door. I know my worth. Actually 2 women and 1 bottle. I deserve it. Thank you. 
One of the main reasons men rarely forgive cheating is because we do the approaching. It takes courage, energy and skill to get a woman. Then I find out you let a swamp rat touch your private parts? The pain is different.
You should ask a woman to be your girlfriend. Explicitly. It's not marriage but it's still a proposal. He spoke to you for 2 weeks so he's automatically your bf? You're not an item on a shelf. He must ask. Don't assume. We all know what they say about assumptions..
Why do motivational speakers associate working 9-5 with unsuccessful? Yeah being an entrepreneur is great. But does that make your employee a failure? Even indirectly, you will need workers.
You know what really bothers me? People wait until you're dead... to celebrate, appreciate, support, send you nudes or love you. What's stopping you now? I'm right here.

Girls think it's cute &amp; “spicy” to try give you a blowjob when you're watching a game. Woman can't you see that Man U is down 2-1 with 9 mins to go in the semi-finals. Get away from my private parts.
King David: spies on a bathing woman, orchestrates her husbands death, marries her and becomes Gods favourite? Sounds like an episode off Game of Thrones. Heaven might just be fun after all..
You're 8 years happily married with 3 beautiful children then one day a Dr tells you that you've actually never been able to have kids. Dangerous is an understatement 
People that assign each sock it's own a peg on the washing line, are the same special animals that spend 31 hours at an ATM playing Pacman.
Your boyfriend thinks being under the weather is getting caught in the rain. This is the same clown who only mostuirizes his upper body. Why are you with him again?
When he needed a loan to start a business, I whatsapped him bible verses. When he couldn't afford to buy me expensive purses, I prayed for him. When he needed someone to talk to, I gave him vagina. He still left me and now he's rich. - Women Who Say They Built Men, 2014, pp 72

I don't care how in love you think you are, get a DNA test. ASAP. All that the baby looks like me talk is a joke. It's 43 seconds old. It looks like a potato.
Nudes should be artistic. Lighting. Angles. Poses. Location. Show some class. Not just a picture 2cm away from your vagina. Send that nonsense to your gynecologist.
Good looking people seem to always have dull personalies. They think being beautiful allows them the right to be boring. They're also the easiest to cheat on because they think they ar- nevermind. I've said too much.
There are 3 reasons a man will stay after being cheated on. He would struggle to get another woman; he's a beta male; he actually needs you for other reasons - most likely financial. I'd rather sweep the desert with a fork than forgive Jezebel.
It's okay that you have no money. That means nothing to me. I will take care of you and buy you anything you need. All I want from you is your kind loving heart. Thats all. - said no woman ever
First time I was cheated on, I was devasted. Couldn't eat. Wasn't showering. Spent days in bed drinking. My mistress had to nurse me back to health. Women hate us. This is my testimony.
I just woke up and realized that women still haven't apologized for their grandmothers actions. I'm calling on all men to deny their women sex until they say sorry for that fiasco in the garden of Eden. They haven't even said thank you for the rib. Jesus.
I have $100 for anyone who can tell me why a woman stays with him after finding out he's cheating.
Just because she posted i need a boyfriend does not mean you should nosedive into her messages and die.  It's a hint - and it was never yours to catch.  There's a specific person she was signaling.   At least now you know why she never replied.
If you ever want to hear hardcore gossip, get your aunties and their friends in 1 room.  Jesus help us.. apparently Pastor Thomas has only 1 testicle
When you're at a point in your life where you're finally ready to not be happy for the rest of your life 
Not all women are dangerous. It's just the short ones you need to fear. Compact evil. Over 18 but still climbing kitchen counters to reach the shelf? If that isn't a sign of demonic possession, I don't know what is.
Women do all that spying, investigative journalism, CIA homework on a man just so they can ignore their friend's advice, cry and stay anyway.
Are those stretch marks?? I'm sorry I wasn't expecting that. I can't do this. Please put your clothes on and leave. - said no guy ever
The worst time to piss off your girl is right after she's had a hairdo. She's feeling brand new and as a result her cheating superpowers are heightened. Dangerous beasts.
Kissing in the rain is for the movies. Try it in real life and you just end up with hair food and makeup in your stomach.
The reason alot of you are single is because of your unrealistic standards. You're a 3. 4 on a great day but you're looking to date a 9. Hunt within your league and stop throwing ice cubes at the sun.
This lady once said she only drinks champagne. Nothing else. I had to drive and buy champagne, came back and she asked me for an opener. Women are sicker than sick.
You met each other drunk. You had makeup on. He wakes up the next day. He sees you. He doesn't like anymore. You sold him a Ferrari. He woke up to a Toyota. You understand his frustration right? Right?
Rich people simplify their road to success. They won't mention the luck and connections they had. So don't bother matching your schedule with theirs. You're setting yourself up for depression.
Let a woman buy you shoes &amp; socks every year for your birthday and she'll run tell her friends she built you into the succesful man you are

The more you aggressively show you like her, the less interested she'll find you. You come across as a crusty hyena. Women can smell desperation - it's their 7th sense. Be moderate in your approach.
Humans automatically associate celebrities with intelligence. Fame does not equal high IQ. So take their actions/advice with a grain of salt. A famous blind man.. is still a blind man. Don't be led astray.
A woman will be 7 hours pregnant and already threatening you with child support. Queens of comedy.
You have to be clinically insane to walk in to a marriage with money and not sign a prenuptial agreement. Love makes people eat stupidity. Protect yourself and wear a financial condom.
Your friend will pass by your place for 12 mins after an afternoon of intense cheating just in case his wife/girlfriend asks where he was. You're the alibi by force. Bloody swamp rat.
*throws phone across the room* 
Women don't appreciate how hard it is to impress them. We have to be funny, charming, straight to the point but not too forward... within the first 2 mins.. otherwise you not getting that number.
when will God give me my soulmate You've had 8 relationships in 11 months. That's 8 failures with 1 common denominator... and if you solve for x the answer is u. Leave Yahweh out of it.

If this is women empowerment then I might just be the greatest feminist of all time. I've been supporting the porn industry for decades. 
men are intimidated by women with money Really? You pay bills? And dates? And buy my car? All I have to do is be a stay-at-home dad that provides penis? Where are these intimidating aliens? We would like to see them.
You can't blame women for expecting money from the relationship if that's what you used to attract her. You were in the VIP drinking champagne, calling BMWs cheap &amp; bragging about trips to Spain. You set the precedent. Deal with it.
Do your boyfriends know that you log on twitter to laugh at another man's tweets? 
To women, romance = money. From vacations to gifts to dinners. I dare you to just make noodles, light a candle and say happy birthday. She'll be done with you in 9-10 working days. Max.
She lies and tells you she's pregnant, you stop using a condom and only then actually get her pregnant. I'm telling you hell is empty. Demons are here.
Whenever your girlfriend shows a friend a picture of you, she quickly mentions your amazing personality. Anyway. I've said too much.
I hate when people pretend to be checking up on you with the fake how's your family small talk, when all they really want is a favour. Please don't waste time. Just ask so I can say no.
Just because you call him daddy, doesn't make him your father. 
Weak men think blindly agreeing with women will get them sex. “thanks for backing me up, come smash my vagina into pieces on Thursday as a reward” - said no girl ever
Pretty women will always be intimidating to approach.. until you actually talk to them. 98.73% of the time there's nothing upstairs. Nothing to fear. Nobody's home.
Women always claim to love a big penis.. until it arrives. Then they just spend time running away from it on the bed. It's so annoying. But you can't relate can you? Ant Man.
You've never had sex in your life. Get well soon. 
Sometimes a straight forward i like you is required. Some people don't have time for your indirect hints embedded in the da Vinci Code. Get to the point.
why do men like sex so much Says a woman who'll be calling you her father at the top of her lungs, 6 minutes into it daddy daddy  Messi is special. Women are something else.
If you tell your friend their partner is cheating, there's a good chance they'll resent you for telling them. People would rather just be fooled than told they were fooled.
Wait. Do you ever take accountability for messing up your relationships? Are you the problem? Do you know why your last 6 partners dumped you?
Then never search for truth. The number 1 cause of divorce is seeking the truth. Women love looking for the truth. Then when they find it they can't handle it. 
Make eye contact with a Jehovahs Witness on the street and you're going home with 47 pamphlets.
The Friendzone is an area designed for cowards. Just tell her you like her. You get rejected? Move on. You wanna play Mr Friend and sit around watching her get devoured by others? Madness.
If we're friends with benefits you're not allowed to get into a relationship without giving me 30 days notice. I call to book an appointment and you tell me you're with hubby? You uncivilized beast.
Girls will fake an entire pregnancy just to keep you around then have a miscarriage. Now you can't leave her 'cause you just lost a baby together. You'll only find the truth out in heaven.
😂 yeah I think that's the best way to go. I've been offered sisters I've had to humbly decline. Embarrassing stuff. 
Who raised you animals? Everyone knows that if there's a pregnant lady standing with no seats available, you don't just sit. Close your eyes and pretend to be asleep.
Please don't forget to pray for your friends. They smile and laugh but deep down they're not okay. They haven't had sex in months. Some years. Genitals are just urination devices.
You walk into some toilets and really begin to question whether the body really is the temple of God. Some smells can break your faith.
3 things an ugly person always has: • Great personality • Direct messages drier than the Sahara  • The inexplicable need to start fights

That awkward moment when you purposely start a fight, hoping for steamy angry make-up sex.. then they leave you forever.
If your friend says dyou have any sisters or friends like you? to your girlfriend... he's basically just offered her his penis. And your dumbass is standing there smiling.
Ladies before you officially start a relationship, get on that bed and masturbate for him until you climax. Show him.  “he never gave me an orgasm” but you don't know how your own vagina works either? Insanity.
This is how you should post your partners on social media. Safety first 
Goodnight to all the faithful women out there. All 9 of y'all.
Single mothers always have kids who never go to bed. It's like they know you're there to eat their mother. 11pm lil rascal still can't sleep. Cockblocking level Satan.
Soon as you cum everything becomes crystal clear again. That's why you gotta jerk off before you leave the house. You don't want your genitals making decisions for you.
If your girlfriend has a male bestfriend.. that man has, is or will enjoy her genitals. Why d'you think he's always smiling like a villain when he sees you? He's eating in plain sight.
When you ask for her number and she says no, let me take yours If you listen closely you can almost hear the devil laughing as you get rejected.
A common mistake men make is dropping all their mistresses as soon as they get a new girlfriend. You gotta wait a few months. She's your girlfriend but you're not her boyfriend until she passes probation. It's in the Bible.
I don't like cats or dogs. I'm not an animal person. But I dont mind chickens. Nandos does a great job there. 
When she asks when your last relationship was, you have to choose safe. Like a month ago. Can't reveal you've been surviving on masturbation for 37 months. Nobody wants someone nobody wants.
I really do wonder if women sit down and think you know he's actually such a great guy. Maybe I should stop cheating  I wonder.
If you're hitting on an older woman and she says youre a baby. She wants you. Keep pushing. Sexual intercourse is close. You're almost there.
Once you forgive him for cheating it's done. You opened Pandoras box. He might not cheat today. Or tomorrow. But it's allowed. You signed off on it. Goodmorning.
I can't guarantee impregnation. But I will certainly try. Hard. Consistently. At least 3 times a day. Everyday. Until boredom do us part. 
Handsome guy = horrible sex Rich = ugly &amp; STDs Broke = great sex Handsome &amp; great sex = serial cheater  We won't let you ladies win. That's the menu. From Genesis till forever.
The beautiful thing about social media is that people expose themselves for the imbeciles they truly are. I mean think about it. You're constantly sharing your thoughts. Not long before you reveal you have the IQ of brown bread.
why do men just sleep after sex Excuse me but I just lost billions of my kids in 6 minutes plus your vagina is a tranquilizer. I am mourning &amp; heavily sedated. Let me rest in peace woman.
I had no choice really. It was either be funny or die a virgin. I chose wisely 
We men are so pure. We don't care if your dress cost R3500 or R70. We can't even tell. It doesn't matter. We just love you for you. Do women even deserve us? I wonder.
Missionary position in the morning? Insanity. I mean I like to live life dangerously too but I draw the line at dragon breathe. Anyway. Goodmorning.

Being rejected by someone ugly is a different kinda pain. At that point you realize that the person you found ugly, found you uglier. A mind f*ck.
Twitter people are angry humans. Always fighting. You know what. When the lockdown is over, let's all meet somewhere wearing usernames as badges. If you die, you die.
i want a reliable, financially stable man who can protect and provide for me - a girl that burns rice
Sorry I have girlfriends. 
If you're not desirable to her, anything you do will be negatively exaggerated. Send a hi? You're a boring cow. Stare at her? Sexual assault. Unfortunately women don't come with a manual. She just has to like you.
You can cook the food of Gods, dress like a Queen and perform like you have a PhD in Sexual Intercourse. He'll still cheat with a girl that chews with her mouth open. Men are beasts of the dark.

Ladies, becareful of guys that laugh at your jokes abit too hard. Fake laughing till liquid comes out his ears? Nothing is that funny. He's a pro. Trying to hahahaaaha himself into a vagina.
He also said one day this will end.. Jesus said a similar thing. It's been 2000 years. 
Your penis is always small after the breakup. It was fine for the 3 years we were together. You're saying you enjoyed a toothpick for a 1000 days? The jokes write themselves.
I've been pressured and harrassed over adding a flag for months. Hope we're all happy now. 
Everything is abuse nowadays. Can't discipline your own kid in peace. Back in the day you got the cane/belt, cried, asked God to kill your parents, hated them for 64 hours then went back to loving them. The end.
Skinny women porn is like having cornflakes with water. You can consume it and get the job done, but it's just depressing. I've said too much. Goodmorning.

Knowing the internet, this will reach your mother in no time. And beat you she will.

They say it's men that love sex but when that 50 shades of grey movie was released we weren't the ones running to buy ropes and belts. Handcuffs were top of the groceries list.
Being called free really hurts. I'm going to start charging 2 rounds per tweet. 
If you hang with friends and all they do is gossip about other people.. I wonder who they talk about when you're not around.
Me too. Personally I love when they're walking down the street then accidentally trip and fall on to a random penis and mistakenly break your heart. 
Life insurance policies need a how much does your partner choke you during sex? question. There's a certain gender that enjoys this near death activity a bit too much.
You advertise only what you're willing to get rid of. 
Remember those clowns in school that were afraid of girls? You can spot all 957 of them in the comment section of a girls picture saying the same thing wow nice bums baby
Men know exactly what men are capable of. The over protective brother or father. He's over protective for a reason. He knows. Nobody knows men, like men know men. Goodmorning.
What's your opinion on dating a friends ex? Wrong? Ok? Depends? Explain
They're breaking into liquor stores now. You better have state of the art security. 
You pick her up. Wine and dine her. Drop her off. 2 hours later check her Instagram. Only a picture of the food and your car keys made it. You don't exist. Women are magical creatures.
The desire for instant fame on the internet is a disease the WorldHealthOrganization should look into. People will turn into swamp rats for 20 seconds of fame.
Can't I take a day off? 
The freakiest women are the ones with God in their bio. Don't be fooled. They're possessed by demons in the bedroom. I've said too much. Good morning.
Women just love recieving gifts. Even on events that don't make sense.What am I getting for the lockdown? Fat. You're getting fat.
Mmm. Would you humans buy Chinks merchandise? 
Guys don't be afraid to tell your girlfriend you don't have money. The reason she's asking is 'cause she doesn't have either. If she leaves you, then... good riddance to bad rubbish.
You know how women will say they're single or not depending on who's asking? Your girlfriend always says no. Doesn't matter who's asking. Only God loves you. Just focus on yourself.
How famous is he in Kenya? 
Honestly? I would like 6 girlfriends. Ugandan, South African, Nigerian, Kenyan, Zambian and Tanzanian. Please organize soonest.  Regards and Goodnight Chinks 
Because 98.37% of you will find the AIDS cure before her gspot 
I'm happy. Hope that answers your question. 
Yeah I'll log on sometimes when I'm drunk and laugh at a few tweets before I realise I wrote them 
This lockdown. How will I survive 21 days without sex - a guy walking around with condoms in his wallet that expired in 2018
Women just like unpredictable things. Men with IT factors. If you're Mr dependable, always on time and stable.. at some point you become boring. Adam was busy planting trees. Where was Eve?
Forget Tom Cruise. think female pornstars should be the highest paid actors in the world. Imagine all your holes being filled and you're still smiling like a chimp with a bag of bananas.
So true. Support my dreams and invest in my business ideas for 3 years, but if I meet my soulmate on a random Tuesday I'm gone. Nothing personal. You prayed for it. 
As a kid, what did you honestly want to be when you grew up?
When a loose vagina meets a small penis... 
If a guy says babe we really need to talk, he's just going to ask you for a R300 loan. If your girlfriend says that, she's going to confess to sleeping with your father on your mothers birthday.
Social media tryna manipulate men into their delusional standards. “A real man likes stretch marks on a woman coz it's art” No. Real men like whatever the hell they like.
Still hasn't cockblocked more than that one ugly girl every group of women has. 
When a huge unidentified insect flies through the windows, into your bedroom and disappears under the bed.  Night ruined.
If your boyfriend hasn't proposed after 2 years then you must ask him why. He will wake up after 6 years on a random Wednesday, break up with you then get married to some girl 7 weeks later. Ask.
You men don't get money from your girlfriends? Just vagina &amp; socks for birthdays? So your services are free? You're a slave? Sad.
Being told by a woman that she likes you is so nice. It's inexplicably fulfilling. To be wanted cause you're sexually attractive is amazing. But you can't relate can you? Spaghetti face.
😂I've been warned against Kenyan women. You're all black mamba dangerous apparently. 
The timeline is currently full of sexually frustrated women who eat 8 slices of bread for breakfast. It's not safe here guys. Goodnight.
If you follow my advice and your relationship survives, your guardian angel is working overtime. 
You had sex with him when he was broke and a few years later he became rich. Now you're going around telling people that you built him. That is not how vaginas work.
What's that ONE thing you would definitely break up with someone over? Cheating? Lies? Communication? Bad sex?  etc. What?
I think mental illness. 
Women on the internet will say to just be honest, straight forward and tell them if you just want sex. Now try it in real life. You'll never see a vagina. I promise.
Merely life experiences. And drugs. Mostly drugs. 
Women that date married men are extremely special upstairs. You think he'll leave his wife &amp; 2 kids to marry you? Even if he did.. who then fills the position you left open?
Anything over 240 seconds is sexual abuse. 
You need to make women wait for sex. Let her imagination run wild atleast. 2hrs and she's in your underwear? Show some value. Atleast prostitutes get paid. You're free as the wind.
Men don't like breaking up. They prefer acting like wild animals until she does it. All of a sudden he's rude. Unreturned calls. Picking fights. He wants you to fire him.
Your girlfriend picking up your lingo is probably one of the most sincere forms of flattery. Then she breaks up with you and teaches it to her new boyfriend now you're forced to hunt him down and kill him.
Men that hit on waitresses really think they're prince charmings. She's obviously going to laugh at your creepy pickup lines you dusty swamp rat. She's at work. Her tip depends on it.
You approach a lovely lady politely and she replies “can't you see I'm pregnant??” So your lil zygote should stop me from finding love? Women are childish.
If you want to laugh. Hang around ugly people. Great personalities. They always got jokes. It's the gift from the curse. I know this to be true.
Let's make a deal. You stay quarantined, I keep tweeting? 
A Lockdown step guide for dummies: 1) no house parties, Church gatherings or your ONE BEST friend visiting etc 2) watch/listen to/read comedy 3) do not go out unless for mandated work, cared responsibilities, essentials like food/medical supplies  Now spread the word.
During this 21 day lockdown, single people will abuse their private parts out of warranty. RIP genitals. 
You ignore 5 calls from the same person.. then 26 seconds later a private number starts calling. I know it's you. I'm still ignoring you. Bloody swamp rat.
Actually I post pictures of myself half-naked just to show the world that I'm comfortable in my own skin - (Whores, 2020)
You know those girls that he doesn't want you to act like? The ones whose dress code he hates? That's the same type of girl he'll cheat on you with. Men make poison look like milk. Be safe.
What are you up to during the quarantine? Reading novels? Porn? Learning to sing? Drinking? What are you up to?
Actors kiss for 7 seasons and don't even like each other. A guy liked your picture on facebook and you're already picking baby names.
Verify me. 
Pillow talk after sex is crazy. Future kids are named. Their private schools are picked out. She's already making wedding guest lists. It's true love. 5 weeks later you've blocked each other everywhere.
People that ask you what's wrong then 12 seconds later somehow the conversation about them, are truly annoying.
Men will find an illegal Avengers movie download link within 2 days of it's release but haven't found their girlfriends clitoris.. in 3 years. Insanity.
Men will just lie about where they are. Women will let you raise another mans kids. Quality over quantity. 
She's flirting with you on the timeline but ignoring your messages 'cause she's just using you to make some other guy jealous. Wake up you swamp rat. You're a pawn.
One day you will log on and wait for my next tweet. And wait and wait aaand wait. So send me money while I'm still alive. Dollars. 
You see your partner getting 26%'s for assignments and tests.. and you still stay? It's not about you. Leave. Think about your kids.
Sure. What's your mom's number? 
When I die I don't want a pastor up there lying about how good of a man I was. Just play a slideshow of my tweets on a projector and let the audience judge me. Thank you.
If we date for 6 months and you don't once catch me cheating? I'm ending things. I'm not about to fall in love with an imbecile.
You post your bums here 24/7 then complain that you only attract men who just want you for sex. People don't go to strip clubs for the food.
There are alot of vital questions you should ask a lady on the first date. To make sure you're compatible. The most important one is are you just here for free food?
How was the sex? If it was good then the burning of rice can be tolerated. 
Men will cheat in the same bed his wife sleeps in, surrounded by pictures of his 4 kids and mother. Your tiny boyfriend made you his profile picture and you think you're safe.
Good morning to everyone who doesn't sleep with their socks on.
I drank redbull with viagra, shaved my balls clean smooth and actually took a bath with soap.. and now your phone is off? This is the type of evil women are capable of. Inconsiderate creatures.
Uber drivers know where all the wh0res live. Ask a driver about your partner. Good luck.
Have you noticed how people on twitter are forever angry? All that tension. Must be sexual frustration. Not even demon possession causes this.
The Bible says beauty fades away but the heart remains forever. But that doesn't mean I wanna marry Shrek. Your kind heart won't make my penis hard. Priorities.
Get a job. 
You could have all the money in the world and have a penis longer than the last 10 mins at work... a broke guy with nothing but jokes can still steal your girl. Never forget that
When you're single, women are disgusted by  you. You sicken them. They won't even look at you. They hate you. Soon as you get a girlfriend.. they suddenly all want to have your babies. Insanity.
Condom sex? Just say you hate me and we go sleep.
You clean, cook and wash after a man that's already cheating on you? And you think a ring, wedding and kids will change him? It won't. I'm telling you that for free. Happy Womens Day.
Your future husband gets 4 haircuts a month but has had the same toothbrush for 6 years straight... soft as a feather. Anyway. Goodmorning.
The profession doesn't define the persons IQ and business savvy - circumstances do. Remember, no one man knows everything.. but everyone knows something. 
Hypothetically.  How would you prefer to get dumped? Via email, SMS, call, face to face, 'silence' and let it dissolve, fax, whatsapp?
Back in the day you never really knew if you were ugly. Like you weren't 100% sure. But now we have social media. 3 likes? 2 from your cousins? You're a swamp rat. And that's okay.
Masturbation over everything. 
You've been single but on the market for so long, at this point you should just be on sale. Dating you should come with free wifi,  daily cooked food and a 5 year money-back guarantee.
“your girlfriend will kill me” is not flirting. You're 28 not 13. Step it up ladies. Pathetic.
Your future wife actually visits a man who asks “so when will you come cook for me? No cooking happens. But there's alot of eating involved.. If you know what I mean. Anyway. G'morning.
2 signs you're the mistress: 1. his first position choice is doggystyle  2. he doesn't remove his socks during sex  You're welcome.
Find a woman who loves and treats you so well that you have no choice but to hide your other women from her. Simple.
Your girlfriend gets 1746 likes on her picture. 1284 are men. 1198 are cowards so they won't send a message. The other 86 will. 62 of those are her type. I'll leave the rest of the story to your imagination. Goodnight.
Flirting is an art. It's risky business. 1 second you're charming, next thing you come across as satanically horny. It's a thin ass line.
Where's the 3rd one? The aim is to share my love with as many women as possible before I leave this planet 
Some men like to cuddle after sex. Others enjoying chatting. Some just wanna sleep. I prefer going back home to my wife.
Ladies, for your attention.. 
Sex is for reproduction not pleasure. The Bible is very clear on this. All this blowjob doggystyle Luciferian nonsense needs to stop. Anyway goodmorning and Amen.
Ugly women are really underrated. They possess the best sex. They just never get enough chances to showcase their talents. I appreciate them. 
Men can't pretend to be attracted to a woman. Our penises don't allow for pretense. That's why we don't even choose women based on material stuff like cars or clothes they have. You'd have to live on viagra.
Am I the only one that has full blown conversations and arguments when alone? Laughing at the jokes the voices in my head tell me. Anyway. Good morning.
If she's goodlooking and single, she's just picky. If he's goodlooking and single? He's a whore. This is free information. You're welcome.
When was the last time you fought someone? Why were you fighting? Did you win?
Dear ladies, There is no difference between the main girlfriend and the mistress. None is more special than the other. You are both equal in God's eyes and both idiots in the man's eyes. Regards, The Universe
Your future husband gets dressed first and then moisturizes. Everyday for the last 21 years. His feet are dryer than his direct messages. You need to start praying harder before you end up with a swamp rat.
If you're with her and her phone rings and she's like these companies wont stop calling me and doesn't answer.  That's him. That's the guy. My condolences sir.
I dropped my phone and the screen didn't crack. Amen. 
Unless you have a direct line to heaven, the only person who truly knows if your partner is a whore, is the bestfriend. Bribe the friend, get the truth and cry blood.
When someone else's partner is everything you're looking for 
Dear men, If it's been 2 hours since you sent her a direct message with no reply, please consider your application unsuccessful and your face ugly. Regards The Universe
Sex is best when bills have been paid. How can you let a man that owes Mtn R12 sweat on top of you? Poverty isn't romantic. Respect yourself.
Remember when you were a kid and you wanted to be President when you grew up?  Look at you now, all grown up and burning rice. Big dreams.
Christian girlfriends are the funniest creatures. She'll be telling you what the message of the day was at Church, while you're tearing up the condom pack. Anyway.
When did you first realize that you're ugly?
If you're going to brag about living the dream life at least have the decency to hide it from the people you owe money to, you unclean and ungrateful swamp rat. Jesus.
We call ourselves an innovative species and yet success still isn't sexually transmitted. Pathetic. Anyway. Goodnight.
Kids born in 2003 are celebrating 2 year anniversaries. You're 27 and can't get a reply. Last time you felt the touch of a human, a guard was frisking you. You need Jesus.
Immigration officer said I don't look like my passport photo. I said yes that's because I'm handsome in real life. She didn't laugh. I thought it was funny. Anyway. I took my passport and we parted ways.
There are really adult males out there waiting for a woman who can change them for the better You're 31. Do it yourself. Did you even dress yourself this morning? Did mummy put the clothes on the bed for you to wear? Swamp rats. 
Men date multiple women simultaneously in order to find the right one in the least amount of time. It's called parallel computing. Your soulmate is trying to find you ASAP. Why don't women get this?
This twitter place is really a mad house. I was just watching football highlights. Next thing a porn video slid across my screen. Then it was gospel. Organized chaos. Anyway. Goodmorning.
Remember those kids who struggled with Reading Comprehension in school? They're on twitter now.. and you can easily spot them. Imbeciles.
Hi everyone. This is important. If you see this lady anywhere, please immediately start minding your own damn business. 
Yeah they saw the tweet and suddenly went blind 
3 things you don't do with friends or family; have sex with them, loan them money or go into business with them. It rarely ends well.
Some men are broke as hell and yet they have unimaginable talent. You convinced a woman to be your 3rd baby mama? Man you can sell anything then. You could sell mucus to a nose. You're sitting on millions.
We just want to be held close sometimes. Told we're loved from time to time. We want women to listen to us when we talk. Look at my face and not my groin area. We are not pieces of meat. Problem is, women are just using us for sex.
Everytime I see sapiosexual in the bio, it always turns out to be a dumbass. You read a few of their tweets and you can just smell the IQ of porridge.
Women don't like sex? They'll literally go visit the boyfriend for 3 days, phone off and forget to tell anyone. Whole town looking for you thinking you're dead in a ditch. Meanwhile you've just been dicknapped.
People cheat so much more now I kindly disagree. It's just technology that publicizes it more now. Back then your grandfathers had a whole 2nd family 12km away from where you lived. You only found out 3 weeks ago. Now that.. is cheating.
Valentines on social media is a gimmick. It's seemingly a competition of gifts. The more expensive, the more romantic. The funniest part? You don't even get to see the gift-giver. Satanism.
You have 2000 people following you and you couldn't get 1 to be your valentine? 1/2000? Look I'm not calling you useless. The universe is. Anyway. Goodnight.
all I want is your love and attention” they say 3 days later it's i need R850 for..”  Next thing they want the password to your phone. Funny creatures. 
It doesn't matter how pretty or beautiful she is. She could be a goddess. If you cook clean, wash for and love your man, I promise he'll still cheat on you.
Scream as if your hair is on fire. Scream as if Man Utd won the UEFA. Even if you feel nothing, scream as if you were tortured into listening to Justin Bieber music for 10 hrs straight. Scream until he can see your tonsils. Scream. 
😂 very nice but why do they look so unhappy? 
You ever notice how ugly men don't waste time? Soon as he pulls a miracle and gets a beautiful girl, she's pregnant in 4 hours. 7 months later they have 3 kids and 1 on the way. Shreks retire pretty women. ASAP.
It's too late. No one's going to ask you to be their valentine. Just focus on your books and work. And remember, only God loves you.
The problem with being good looking is that when you finally make it.. people will just think you slept your way to the top. Curse from the gift.
This isn't the way to do it. If you're dying for attention, rather drink bleach and let your family talk about you for a few days. I'm busy. 
Women spend centuries in the mirror making sure jeans fit just right on their bum. Centuries. But when you compliment her for having a nice ass, she takes offense. Suddenly you're a pervert. Insanity.
You met each other by cheating on your partners? Then you're going to break up in the same fashion. If you go to sleep with an itchy ass, you'll wake up with smelly fingers. Guaranteed.
If you've ever been sober in a club when people are properly drunk, then you've seen demonic things.
If she says to me im not like other women then the assumption is she doesn't have a vagina. Don't know about you. But that's a deal-breaker for me.
For the same reason dogs chase cars they have no intention of driving 
Top 5 fighters of all time: 1. Ugly people 2. Superman 3. Your girlfriends hairline  4. Mistresses 5. Floyd Mayweather
Ladies, please don't force your son to be your Valentine again. Be lonely alone and let that young man live in peace. Thank you and Goodnight.
Sometimes you see a couple walking together and you can just tell they have boring sex. You can just tell.
Watching Tv together on the couch and she's stroking your beard. So therapeutic and relaxing. But you can't relate can you? Baby face.
Your friend gets a new girlfriend and you have to start budgeting for a baby shower gift immediately because you know he hates condoms.
Hey you. Yes you.  Your future wife will be laying her head on his chest after sucking the skin off his penis tonight. She still loves you though. Goodnight.
Your girlfriend is gaining good weight and getting curves in the right places because her work-husband buys her lunch everyday. You think it's because of your 2 minute rounds. Clown. Your days are numbered.
Welcome Ritah. I am officially your first follower 
Men literally do not pay attention to whether a woman is wearing brand clothes or not. We're not looking at you thinking wow is that a Gucci blouse she has on??   We are simple creatures. We look at ass &amp; boobs. Important stuff only.
I'm not saying women shouldn't propose to men. But if a woman got down on her knees with me? I'd start unzipping my pants. Immediately. Anyway. Goodmorning.
Sometimes you'll be laying next to your partner, look at them and just think to yourself how the hell did I end up with this ugly thing?
People keep sending me pictures of penises. Why? I don't know. 
If your girlfriend has 200 followers atleast 10 guys have sent her messages, therefore atleast 1 guy stands a chance.  If she has 5000 followers...
I'm really sorry I missed your call, I was too busy holding my phone in my hand waiting for it to stop ringing so I could carry on reading tweets.
They say only 3 things can hurt you and make it look like it was your fault ; snakes, police and women. Experience and smarts can't save you. 
99 ways to please him in bed Honestly who writes these articles in magazines? Since when is the male orgasm a bloody game of chess in need of 936 moves? Just touch the penis. The end.
I'm a Man Utd fan. I don't need 7 more inexperienced liabilities in my life. 
Your girlfriend could be dumber than brown bread but get into an argument with her and suddenly she's got a PhD in law and shouting.
I realized the relationship was over when we were watching soccer together and she asked me why the goalkeeper doesn't just pick the ball up and run with it to the other side.
Just tell her you're related to me. 94.63% success rate. 
Well done. These other swamp rats seemingly missed it. Disappointing. 
Are you still dating girls that don't have transport money? In 2020? Love yourself man. Please. I beg you.
People who chew chocolate are serial killers. Be careful. You're welcome and goodnight.
Well if you incest, go for it. 
Calling her cellphone number right there to make sure it's correct makes you look desperate, insecure and weird. It's also pointless because if she lied.. what then?
Can you imagine being at work and your manager tells you to go home early and you throw a tantrum. Jesus. 
You're 29 with a 4 year old uncle because your grandfather is allergic to condoms and still hasn't mastered the art of pulling out. Madness.
People keep saying this. So basically I'm just a free therapist to you people? Not even cheap. Free? That's depressing. The irony. 
If you have a best friend that you're suddenly attracted to and you want to take it further.. my advice to you is don't. Find someone else to love then hate forever.
Thanks. Out of all these swamp rats, you're the only one that wished me a happy new month 🙂 
Sometimes just say you're beautiful and walk away. You don't have to harass for her number everytime. It's a compliment and you're not a Sim registeration agent.
When you have money or provide satanic sex, women will ignore red flags. You could beat up a 9 year old kid infront of her and she'll tag team with you. Amazing penis + big bank = love is blind.
😂 nice. You're destined for greatness 
Sounds like I could make money off this. Anyway glad I could be of use 🙂 
Sacrificed an entire rib for that gender and they won't even split the bill. Talk about ungrateful.
A guy will introduce his girlfriend as my wife to his friends and she'll be grinning ear to ear. You're the 3rd one they've met this month. Relax yourself. Relax.
Your girlfriend only shows you the messages from guys she doesn't like. The men she can replace you with tomorrow? She deletes those messages. Goodmorning.
Then why do you keep choosing the wrong men? 
Black jeans are a scam. 2 washes and they're grey. Robbery.
You get a girl pregnant by accident and your girlfriend is already talking about breaking up. No 2nd chance as if she doesn't make mistakes. Ridiculous.
The number of women who'll show up to my funeral as my girlfriend, only to find that they were the mistress... is scary. Then there's my wife. Glad I won't be there - it'll be total chaos.
There's a special special place in hell for women who promise to send nudes and keep you waiting for the rest of your life.   You know yourselves. Bloody swamp rats.
You're right. If you peoppow meet your new partner in my tweets, invite me to the wedding, name your kid after me or send me $245. Don't contact me when you breakup. 
Ladies don't rush love. There's a man out there praying to God daily for a woman like you who he can cherish, love, marry and cheat on for the rest of his earthly life. Be patient. He's coming.
Welcome and don't take eveything I post personal. Just some of it 🙂 
Imagine spending years perfecting the art of pulling out only for the Doctor to tell you you're shooting blanks. Madness.
Love you too and good morning 
It smells bad when abused. The world would be such a better place if people didn't spray half of it after taking a shit. Got the whole house smelling like strawberry faeces now. 
😂 you win the award for the worst tweet of Jan 28 2020. Congratulations 
They won't date a guy that lives with his parents... but they'll gladly screw one that lives with his wife and 3 kids. I won't say who they are. They know themselves.
If you never grew up in a house with cockroaches.. please block me this instant. I really can't have people who don't know what life is about around me.
If you're not a millionaire by age 30.. start stealing white peoples dogs and wait for them to put up reward signs. You're welcome. Goodnight.
I have $150 for anyone who can tell me why women cheat.
Before the internet, one had to walk up to a lady and ask her out. Cost? Charm + jokes + courage + embarrassment. Nowadays... a brand new lady is only 1 direct message away. Cost? 2 seconds. God is Great.
When she met you, you were an asshole. She said she loved the fact that you were crazy. Never met a guy like you before, she said.  2 months down the line.. all she complains about is the fact that you're a crazy asshole.   Women.
Goodnight to all the men who've never made a woman orgasm. You're basically a public holiday on a Saturday.
Is your mother rich? 🤔 
Women that don't cook, clean and suck dick are forever asking, where are the good men?  The good men just finished eating dinner, relaxing in a clean house about to get their penises sucked Sahara desert dry.
I don't understand how people failed to believe in Jesus. If a guy changed water into Hennesy at a party?? I'd follow that man everywhere. No questions asked.
Goodnight everyone. It's technically morning here. But anyway just Incase I don't wake up tomorrow/today... enjoy the rest of it🙂
Wait. Do women hit and run too?
Bill Cosby's wife stayed after his rape allegations. Kobe Bryants wife stayed after his sexual assault scandal. Spice stayed after Beckham was accused of cheating. Magic Johnson's wife stayed with him after he got HIV. My wife left me coz I was liking girls pictures on Facebook.
Have you read Genesis? Adam started this. Tried arguing with her and before he knew it he was eating the fruit with both hands. 
Whenever I meet a pretty lady, the first thing I look for are signs of intelligence; if she doesn't have that, then I know she's mine.
Apparently so. People keep telling me this. Not sure when or where it is. Am I getting paid? The organizers need to clarify a lot. 
Goodmorning everyone. If you ever feel like life is overwhelming and you need a favour or someone to talk to please don't contact me. Thank you.
I have $150 for anyone who can tell me why men cheat.
She'll spend money on me. Women are the stingiest mammals on planet earth. A woman parting ways with her money for a man? A true miracle. Makes Jesus turning water into wine a joke. 
You're blind. 
You're single because you think that your stock price is higher than what the market is actually willing to pay. In layman's words, you're ugly. Lower your standards and humble yourself.
Men are so easy to love. Feed him. Suck his penis occasionally. And laugh at all his jokes. And don't look at other men. And give him money. That's all. Please just cooperate ladies.
Sometimes the orgasm is so powerful your toes curl so hard and get locked you almost get crippled. Jesus.
If your man isn't crying and holding on to you after sex, you failed as a woman. 
A man will cheat on you then send you a message 2 months later when he's horny asking what happened to us?, as if he just woke up from a 13 year coma.  Funny creatures we are.
A girl will get sleep with half the town then when you try, she's suddenly now found God and wants a serious relationship. Madness. I also just want a takeaway meal. Please and thank you.
husband cheats: he's an ungrateful pig!  wife cheats: there has to be a reason she did it. He must've pushed her to it.
Sex freaks? Quiet girls? Big mouths? Manchester United? This looks very familiar.  Anyway. Goodnight. 
Goodnight to the single humans that'll be alone on Valentines. God loves you.
The worst tweet of 22 Jan 2020 goes to you sir. Congratulations. 
You guys need to grow up and stop asking ladies how many men they've slept with.  The answer was, is and will always be 3.
Ugly people getting married every Saturday because they don't have standards. 
They cry when fictional TV characters die. They cry when they're bored. They cry when they're born. They cry to feel better. They cry when you're winning the argument they started.  Long story short, I do not know. 
Best people to date are the saved, retired whores in church. The sex is amazing and they pray for you. Blessings and orgasms. 2 in 1. A special deal Black Friday can't beat.
If I answered this question, twitter would have no choice but to take my account 
If you want to see the Masters of Cheating, hang around people in long distance relationships. Those creatures are gifted whores. I've said too much.
Approximately 84.24% of women aged between 18-35 eat 8 slices of bread for breakfast but no one wants to talk about this act of satanism. Anyway. Good morning
Trump. He's an entertaining idiot. Reminds me of someone I know. You might know him too. Anyway. Goodnight 
The quiet girls. Those are the sex freaks. Forever quiet.   They're always thinking of new demonic ways of having sexual intercourse.
Men aren't emotionally unavailable. We just don't open up to every single person that touches our genitals.. unlike a certain gender I know. You've fallen inlove with 4 guys in 9 months? Jesus.
They'll read this and buy us condoms. 
“how was your day?” at 7:24am  This is why I stay off whatsapp. Distance myself from madness.
Whenever I see “free spirit” in someone's bio, I know they have an STD.
What's the point of screaming go deeper as if I've got some other half of my penis hidden under the pillow. Bloody swamp rat.
You can actually be on twitter for years and never receive a direct message. 98.4% of the time it's because you're ugly.
Sperm is literally the best skin care cream in the world. And it's free. Women don't deserve us. Am I lying?
Why are ugly women such nice and funny people? Honestly. They're the best company. I love you uglies so much.
Guys listen to me. If a girl has headphones on, don't bother her. She clearly doesn't want to talk to nobody. Please.
If your girlfriend cooks you a shitty meal. Don't be ungrateful and complain. Just say “mmh babe wow nice meal”  Then find the source failure that taught her to cook and kill it.
I have $100 for anyone that can translate this into english. 
People that can't talk without touching you after every sentence. I hate you.
Money. Sex. And money. Don't get me wrong. They like the romantic gestures - rose petals leading to the bedroom etc. But do not forget the money. Preferably cash. 
Good morning everyone. Guess what? I woke up sexy again.
When your friend starts dating a girl and changes his whole lifestyle, you know her sex is killer. He suddenly stops going to church and starts smoking weed rolled with bible pages? The vagina is deadly. RIP. He is gone.
You think you can control women? Female humans? You must be insane. Adam spent half of Genesis telling Eve not to eat the damn fruit. God himself said no. What did Eve do?
If you're caught between buying him that new playstation5 or weaves for yourself. Get the weave. It'll never cheat on you.
If people don't grow old in heaven will babies who died at birth, forever be 30 seconds old?
It's fine. Take the socks. It'll give you the license to last 53 secs in bed and tell her the same thing 
And he didn't do anything? So he doesn't think your girlfriend is good enough for him? Get rid of that disrespectful man 
If you want to get cheated on, date a doctor or nurse.   night shift  I've said too much. Goodnight.
If you have young kids around the house and it suddenly gets quiet, they are busy destroying something.
We've always had sex toys. Vaseline and tissue. Household products so they form part of grocery shopping. 2 birds 1 stone. 
You girls need to stop telling your new boyfriends what your ex did wrong. We don't care. We're here to do you wrong too.
Ladies listen to me. Men know if they want to marry you. Quickly. 3 years dating and you haven't even had a discussion about marriage? 1095 days? You must have 9 lives. I've said too much. Goodnight.
We can debate almost anything else but you can't argue with that African women are beautiful.
These younger women try too hard to be freaky in bed. It's too much.  You're not even on medical aid but busy swinging from the ceiling. Get down from there Tarzan.
Don't flirt with me if you're not going to marry me.
What a loser. Scum. You never tell a woman she's overweight. Ever. Just buy a treadmill for her birthday and leave the rest to God. 
When you're single, you could die in your bed tonight and neighbours would only report something smelling from your house mid July. No one cares about single people.
Hello. Sorry to bother you but would you be ever so kind to make me acquainted with your genitals? 
Whole royal family is full of ugly humans. I'd fit right in 
We could literally date for 6 years. If I meet my soulmate on Thursday. I'm leaving you Friday morning. Saturday is rehearsals. Sunday I'm happily married.
This is the 2nd worst thing I've ever read in my life 
There are men walking on this earth with size 6 and less feet.. and you think God doesn't have a sense of humour?
You girls fake your orgasms and make us believe we're masters of sexual intercourse then go tell your friends that we're swamp rats who can't locate gspots with binoculars. You're abusive.
You've probably met your boyfriend-in-law already. He tickles her at work everyday and calls her Beyonce. She giggles like a 5 year old. He asks if she slept well cause she looks stressed - that's when your ugly face pops in her head. Your days are numbered.
If she's asking you for transport money to go back home, you shouldn't be having sex with that person.
So your girlfriend's friends are whores.. but she isn't? Okay.
Get her a promise ring then marry someone else. She'll never forget you. Ever.
I walked over to her table, told her to order drinks on me and come talk to me when I start looking handsome. She never came. 
You girls will be educated with high IQs and great careers ahead of you...only to let a swamp rat with Abibas shoes and R70 to his name, ejaculate inside you. Why
Men cheat because they believe in spreading love.  Our hearts are bigger than our penises and society hates us for it.
Goodnight to all the ugly men. Only God loves you.
Your email address is joyce58sexyphiri@yahoo.com and you want potential employers to get back to you? Swamp rat
True. A woman will choose a funny guy over a goodlooking one. One minute she hates your face, next thing she's hahahaing, boom she's pregnant with twins. 
I know girls get butterflies in their stomach when they see the man they like.   We men do too hey. In our balls. And they disappear. After the 1st round.
You notice how you always always run into everyone you know when you're walking around with the ugly girlfriend? Ridiculous.
Hey lonely. Yeah you. You haven't been kissed in months. Your lips are drier than your direct messages.
Women: I don't like uncircumcised men Also women: I like convertibles
Lend? Refund? Wow you're lucky. Give it to her and if she actually does try pay you back.. you know you've found a real one. 
Match made in heaven. 
If he has sex with you with his socks on.. you're the mistress. 
Ladies, if a guy asks so what's your type of guy? he just wants to know what to pretend to be so he can sex you. Be careful.
You're single because everytime you get on the bus, you grab your phone, face down and start liking tweets.    Your husband is trying to catch your eye but you're too busy being a swamp rat.
It means you're super ugly. She's not saying that to men she's interested in. 
No female humans will come near you when you're single. You disgust them. Soon as you acquire a girlfriend, now they wanna suck the skin off your penis. Women need help.
Before you marry them - stay with them. See them in their natural habitat. You don't wanna spend R100k on marriage only to realise he sings gospel songs when he's taking a shit. 
When you're young it's like having a heart attack. When you're older it's like popping a pimple. 
You tell your girlfriend that your charger is broken and she decides to buy you a new phone. Women don't listen.
Goodnight. Stay and be safe. Please.
If you can't afford children. Just masturbate and leave peoples daughters alone. Spread the word.
Women will give you sex and socks for your birthday for 3 years straight and go around telling people that they gave you everything. “everything”😂
I see the internet has made plagiarism normal. In the real world, as you may know, if you steal someone's intellectual property you're expelled, suspended, discredited etc. This world.
I swear I've seen this before. I wonder who said it first.. 
I love me too 🙂 
When men revenge cheat, they go out, buy 27 prostitutes and come home. The end. When women revenge cheat, they go get pregnant with twins and let you raise them for 23 years. Respect
Let me get this straight. You cook, support his dreams, clean, suck his penis, do laundry... and you want him to propose? Why? No need really. You're already performing at 1000%
Jesus Christ an article😂 
Let them continue to love him. 
The good news is, you can tell them whatever you like. The bad news is, I don't think they care. All 49 of them.   On that note, goodnight people. 
Men will throw away 13 years of marriage, 4 kids and half their net worth for 2 mins of new sex. And you think you're safe because your little boyfriend introduced you to his mother? Okay
This is the definition of useless information. 
Don' trust anyone. People can just change hey. 5 mins ago I was wearing jeans.. now I'm in shorts.
I am officially your first follower 🙂 
The private affairs of other people, especially wealthy ones, does not concern me. Know why? Because they're not concerned about me. 
Wow. You stole my entire post - with a few tweaks. I'm flattered. 
Women what? 
Don't tell your girl secrets. She'll bring it up during arguments. In public too. Shouting. You're at KFC fighting, now everyone knows your dads penis is shaped like a banana.
😂 Your vocabulary. Hope to learn more big and useless words from you soon man 
Practice makes perfect. Next question. 
Women: I want my boyfriend to be my best friend Also women: no you're my best friend i can't date you
I've always wanted to be called medicine. I appreciate it 🙂 
Last name rats, first name swamp. 
First few weeks of dating: she sleeps naked or in sexy lingerie. Midnight sex is the norm. Few months into the relationship she's sleeping in a full waterproof Nike tracksuit, helmet and gym gloves. This world.
Men are not perfect beings. We also fall short of the glory of God sometimes. Your man cheats? Don't judge him. It's not his fault. Pray for him. Be there for him. Always. 
There's no such thing as “she trapped me”. You didn't ejaculate vanilla yoghurt into her. That was sperm you swamp rat.
You expect me to believe you have a girlfriend? I'm 71 not blind and stupid 
If you cry infront of her and she still doesn't forgive you for cheating, then she never deserved you in the first place. Move on.
Just make money and hire someone to do all that for you. If that fails, have children and put those slaves to work. 
When you find the toilet seat in a public toilet facing down... don't lift it. I repeat. Do not lift it. You will see things that will shake your faith. 
all I need is R1000 man. I'll pay you back. You can trust me - a guy that's cheating on his wife
Merry Christmas to Ethiopians celebrating today 🙂 
Okay😂 I am officialy your first follower 
I doesn't matter if you faked your orgasms, I faked everything to get you in that bed.  1 - 0
Guys look here. It's perfectly okay to have a conversation with a woman and not ask for her number. Learn to relax. On that note, G'night.
You'll have unprotected sex with random people weekly but won't open an umbrella indoors because it's bad luck. You belong in a circus.
Being single during Winter builds character.
Why is this generation obsessed with letting the world know about embarrassing situations? Coping mechanism? If I shit my pants I'm taking that to the grave - not telling my neighbours. 
Mary died a virgin. 
If you have a mistress go spend the day with her rather. You don't need negative energy in your life. Life's too short. 
Please don't be fooled by my extraordinarily handsome face. I am just a simple man. Good morning 🙂 
Men: she should have a nice ass and face  Women: he needs rock hard abs, big penis, height, money, soft hands, lips, sexy fingerprints, kidneys, photosynthesis and amazing veins. Atleast.
This generation. Women actually cheat back now. Whatever happened to just crying, eating ice-cream and forgiving him?
Holy crap mate. This is amazing 😂 
?????? 
Your ex sends you a text saying he/she is in your town, stranded and desperately needs a place to sleep for the weekend. You agreeing?
Unhooking a bra is a survival skill one needs to master early in life. Anything longer than 1.47 seconds to unhook and she'll smell the amateur in you and change her mind. 
If the girl you want is amongst her friends, you want to befriend the ugly one first to gain her support and unlimited access to your queen.  The ugly girl is always the Minister of Home Affairs.
Make millions with bitcoin &amp; forex. Ask me how! - a guy living in his parents house
Never leave the house with a low battery phone and then miss a call because it's off. That's an act of war. 
Jonah really went out cheating for 3 days and the best excuse he had for his absence to his wife was “sorry i was in whales stomach” What a legend.
Aside from the pastors family, the most respected people at church are the rich ones. If you're poor, forget. Goodmorning 🙂
Okay let me go to bed before I start talking more nonsense. I'm tired. Goodnight. Love and appreciate you all.
Ladies, there's no such thing as a wrong hole.
Kids born in 2004 are in stable relationships and you're 28 still burning rice. Swamp rat.
Girlfriend: “why don't you trust me??”  Lady. I put my penis in your mouth full of teeth. If that isn't trust I don't know what is. I really don't.
The best condom advert I've ever seen 
Be born. Go to school. Graduate. Get a job. Start a family. Die. Life is debatabley a scam.
Hey everyone. My intention is never to offend anyone. Ever. If I have I would like to take this opportunity to just say that I don't care. Goodmorning 🙂
Don't spend R100k on getting married just to go home to a rented house. On that simple note, goodnight 🙂
Men can procrastinate anything except ejaculation. The curse from the gift.
Ugly people are my favourite people to hang around. We're naturally entertaining, down to earth and our conversations are amazing.
Even scarier if you tell her to relax.. and she actually relaxes. Now you have to sleep with one eye open or risk waking up in heaven. 
I like how fat people can make fun of skinny ones &amp; get away with it. But let someone skinny call a fat person a jumping castle and it's Armageddon.
The difference between the mistress and the side-dude is, the mistress is looking to get promoted. Side-boyfriends are very happy just being on the sidelines sexing. Quiet. No drama. Just sexual intercourse.
The real question is would any girl with eyes and in her right state of mind, date you 
You can't really explain twitter to outsiders. They just have to join themselves, be confused, leave, return 7 months later and become addicted.
The prettier your girlfriend is, the more other girls want you. I don't understand the logic but it's in the Bible.
Goodnight to everyone that's been single the whole year.
4 days later but atleast I finally saw it. You will get more followers in good time. Goodnight Pam 
Your girlfriend is in the kitchen smiling at her phone and you're on the couch asking when the food will be ready. Your days are numbered.
Don't ask me if I think your baby's cute. You know deep down it's a cockroach. I'm not going to hell for silly lies.
Goodnight only to the people who haven't had sex this year.
Please tell me you're a tongue. 
President of twitter doesn't sound too bad at all.. 
I want to believe I have friends not fans. But Happy new year to you too🙂 
It's 2020. Stop giving these girls free sex until they've shown you that they deserve you. She must atleast buy you a pair of sneakers before she even sees your penis. Respect yourself you whore.
Ladies should I follow him? 
Each and every year that goes by is like a book read. It may be hard to comprehend but never let it go by with zero growth.  Happy 2020 and all best to you and yours.
Charging your phone on a laptop is like having sex with a condom.
Once you accept that you're ugly, nothing in life can stop you. I promise.
Taking your new boyfriend to a place I introduced you to is the ultimate form of disrespect. I will burn down that restaurant. Try me.
I'll be alone for New Years. None of you invited me to your parties.
I don't care that you have a small penis. I don't care that you have no money. I just love you for you  - said no woman ever
Your best years are yet to come, save money, don't worry yourself with who has achieved what when - run your own race at your own pace and don't drink and drive. 
2020 will be amazing. Wait for it. 
Men will cheat on their woman for years. With multiple women. She winks at a guy once and he's done. Clinically depressed. Not eating, bathing once a week and drinking the pain away.
Advanced masturbation 
Gentlemen here's 1 secret to success; work for a company that has many high positioned women.. and sleep your way to the top.
Goodnight. 
Children hold all the answers. If you want to know if you're really ugly or not, ask a kid.   There's no filter in those lil demons.
Celibacy isn't an achievement if you're ugly. That's just your life. 
I would say you sound like a virgin. 
If you have $50000 and someone offers you $1000 will you say no? Exactly. Now stop asking why people cheat.
Does your boyfriend know that you're on twitter laughing at other mens jokes?
I'm up. And I know you won't believe me when I say this but I woke up sexy again. 
If I wake up tomorrow, I will see you then. Goodnight everyone.
If she says “sorry no I just got out of a relationship im not ready” ... she's lying. She's ready. You're just ugly.   You're welcome?
Remember when you were a kid and they called you ugly? Look at you now, all grown up and still ugly.
Every girl in the universe has only slept with 3 guys. And it's been 6 months since they had sex. Anyway. Let me my mind business.
I have $500 for anyone who can tell me what men want.
You get a passport [obviously] when you need to travel internationally. After that's said and done it's an option... not the oxygen you're making it to be. 
This man has 94 cattle to his name. Do with this information as you please... ladies. 
My life? From dating a chef, to a lady that burns rice. From Sir Alex Ferguson, to Solskjær. The devil is working overtime in my life. Lord why me
Long distance relationships are insanely funny.. and dangerous. You miss a phone call on the weekend? Your phone battery died on a night out? I'm 746km away from you - that's a declaration of war. Now I'm paranoid looking to go out cheating.
Women will give you sex for your birthday then ask if you're happy. Yes babe I'm happy to have your vagina for the 847th time. Thank you so much.
It's possible but unlikely.. and messy. Also that's a rookie move. Rule number 4; always see what her friends look like before you commit. Don't pick Shrek. 
Probably the best sexual intercourse you'll ever encounter in life. Top 3. 
My 2nd wife had 6 toes, her father was a closet Nazi whom I punched at our wedding and she's now a born-again Christian married to a 23 year old. I hope this answers your question. 
I'll wipe my ass with sellotape before I allow anyone to take my cellphone. 
So you want me to gently kiss you behind the ear, whilst slowly caressing your thighs, rubbing your boobs and running my hands through your hair?? 😦 Madam, I don't know what octopus bf you had before but I only have two hands.
I like the purse very much. Anyway. Why are your buttocks on display outside of a salon? If you don't mind me asking. 
Do not marry a woman that hasn't been through her promiscuous phase yet. I've been married 3 times. Learn from my mistakes. You're welcome.
Morning. Ugandan women have been sweet so sweet me. I must visit soon.. 
Good morning. Did anyone miss me
Goodnight to everyone who enjoyed what I posted today. To be continued tomorrow. Be safe.
Not to alarm you. Your boyfriend has being trying to cheat on you but he can't cause he's ugly.
I'm a finansexual; im only attracted to women with money.
Jokes aside. I don't think Tracy Chapman's music is truly appreciated. Her name is very rarely brought up. And yet to me she is a amazing. Certified. I've been a fan for decades.
If you can, ATLEAST TRY to make your profession your actual passion.. your days on this planet will prove easier. 
If she goodlooking and she single, she is the problem  How true is that nowadays?
I appreciate it. I am literally just tweeting my mind. Guess I'm crazy 
Not to alarm you or anything but your girlfriend has a male friend she speaks to everytime you guys are fighting. He's on the bench. Plotting. Waiting. You might have met him already. Anyway.
The secret is to retire.. then tweet recklessly. Like someone I know. I wonder who that might be.. 
I love you too young lady 🙂 
Women don't get caught cheating coz they don't change their routine at all. Same walk. Same sex positions. Same laugh. Men get a mistress and start drinking water all of a sudden.
Peehaps I missed my calling. Anyway I appreciate it 🙂 
Yes please do all of this but I can't guarantee the staying part when my soulmate finally shows up. 
I always laugh at people who are rude to waiters before their meal. That man was in the kitchen wiping his ass with your beef patty. You're eating a cheese anus burger.
Love you too. 
Good morning. I woke up sexy again.
They can plagiarize all they want. But there can only be one Chinks though. On that note.. Goodnight. 
With this face and wallet I would have died a virgin if I never learnt to tell jokes 
Your girlfriend gets drunk on 3 glasses of wine and starts telling you secrets about her bestfriends... and you think her friends don't know you have 1 testicle? Okay
Even from men. Unsolocited. This world is truly something. 
If a woman likes you, she likes you. That's it. You could have sex with her to ambulance siren sounds inside a fridge and she'll tell her friends you're the most romantic guy the world has ever known.
Goodnight everyone. I appreciate all the pictures you send me 🙂
Anything longer than 20 mins is sexual abuse and can be reported to a police station close to you. Jesus Christ 
I'm 71 years old. I have dated close to 100 women in my lifetime. And here's what I can tell you; short women are evil. Spread the word and save a life.
Same to you brother.  I see you're from Nigeria. I love Nigerian women. Beautiful women. 
Who wants to spend New Years with me? I have money. And drugs
Are you really Christian if you hang up Jesus' picture using nails? Blopdy savage.
this one looks easy - men before they approach you  Be careful ladies.
Hopefully you enjoyed your Christmas yeah. I'm too tired to stay up .Goodnight
People actually send me naked pictures of random people and then ask me to send them money. I'm 71 not stupid. Respect me. Thank you.
I have $500 for anyone who knows what women want.
Ladies and gentlemen.. the jury..  your honour..... I rest my case. 
I'm 71 years old and I still don't know what women want. They never give straight answers. It is tough.
For a second there I thought that was my brother. 
Im 71 years old. Life is way too short not to laugh or have a sense of humour. Cry when you must - laugh every chance you can.
Back pains, viagra, high blood pressure, big penis, weak knees and short-term memory. You do not want that. 
Not everyone has the luxury of a family Christmas or wants it. Respect that.
So how was Christmas 2019 for you? What were you up to?
Elton John turned gay after sleeping with Madonna in 1983 
Your last happy Christmas. Enjoy it. 
Thank you sir, I appreciate it. Enjoy your festive season 🙂 
It takes a certain level of skill to be ugly and broke but still date pretty women. Skill that can't be taught. Like herpes - either you have it or you don't.
Merry Christmas to you too 🙂 
Just put it in rice. 
Anyway. Merry Xmas 😊
You need to ask each other what you like. Ask. If her wants are to be folded like a samoosa whilst being choked to the Pearly Gates and back, I will oblige. 
This new generation is truly amazing.19 with 4 kids, a job and a car. When I was 19 I was just finding out that I had to moisturize then put on my clothes and not the other way around.
You sound like you're in pain. Breathe. 
Passport sized photos have never loved me. I look like a squashed frog in em.
Women move on a month before they physically leave you. 
hey long time you're still alive?  no i passed away 6 years ago &amp; this is a hologram. Imbecile
Sounds like masturbation. 
Which part of twitter is this? We're angry and pretending to be mentally stable over here. 
I grew up ugly so I had to have a personality. No choice really. 
Honestly I'm not too sure who's crazier, pisces or people who think signs mean anything. 
Petition to replace have a Merry Xmas with please give me money  All those in favour, say aye
If there's one thing I've learnt on this planet it's that, the customer is not always right. Sometimes the customer just needs a foot up their ass.
No I didn't survive through the polio epidemic just to be rewarded with this nonsense again. 
The male g-spot is not found in our anuses. Ladies please stop spreading this false information. And don't tell me to google it either. Your google once told me I had cancer. It was diarrhea.
This sounds fantastic. Cum and go. 
What clothes are made of.  A thread.
I've been married 3 times. Twitter is better. 
Don't delete tweets when you lose an argument. We all want to learn from your stupidity
I saw a rather interesting debate on whether or not pineapples belong on pizza. The answer is absolutely NOT. What's next? Rice with oranges?
I have R500 for anyone who can explain the link between the shaking of buttocks to keeping the Sabbath day holy 
I don't get the point of having these drawn out arguments with strangers on the internet. It's a public forum with no rules so no one will admit to being wrong anyway. I'd rather wipe my ass with sellotape than debate here.
Just because someone is old does not automatically mean they are full of wisdom. Some of us are dumb fossils
There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have sexual intercourse for more than 30 minutes. I can have an entire nap in that timeframe. Ridiculous
I dreamt I was married to my ex-wife again. Woke up right before she swallowed me whole. That demon 🤣
Good morning everyone. I wish I could stay up as long you younger people. Sleep well
Being a nice person is overrated. 9 out of 10  times someone will mistake that for your weakness. Be nice anyway. Soon we will lower that statistic.
Innocent please do not speak like that. You make me sound like bitcoin 
I told my grandkids if they put me in an old age home I will remove them from my will. They visit me every weekend
I'm 71 years old. To see a girl in her panties took atleast 5 dates when I was growing up. I am scrolling down my phone and its there for free I love this world 
Y'all hate Kim Kardashian for no reason.
I'm 71 years old and one thing I can tell you is that Asian and black women are the best. Everything else is noise.
What will you be up to Dec 31st? I'll be on Twitter
Let her hit the gym for months then get her pregnant.
There's a guy who told us he was about to go propose to his gf. Tweet went viral and he never came back to let us know what happened lool
I'm not part of this statistic. I always show them my results and demand the same from them before we have sexual intercourse -  otherwise no deal. 
Great women still exist they just have flat booties.
What we drinking tonight?
Are we drinking tonight?
People are really pained by this tweet. Why 
I dont mean to brag but I'm 71 years old and dont use viagra or diapers.
Remember when Cardi B drugged, raped and robbed those guys and y'all laughed about it? Lmaooo good times
I sent her money this morning now her phone is just ringing. The devil is a woman.
Me when she says okay go close the door 
I'm 71 years old. Normally at this time I would be sleeping. But I am conversating with so many beautiful black women, I cannot shut my eyelids.
This is what my DMs look like. 
Misandrists remove the 'e' becoz its in ''men as well. Lool. I'm tryna respect the movxmxnt 🙂 
On twitter, the amount of followers you have is a pseudo indication of your influence and what you can say smh. In real life, you talk shit and I will put you in the grave. 84k followers or not.
I'm 71 years old and I dont understand how people can have sexual intercourse for longer than 20 mins. You can get her to orgasm before then. What are you doing champ?
I'm 71 years old and I learnt how to apologize to my children 10 years ago. Do it with yours.
I'm joining Mr Universe next year. It's not just about 6 packs. I want to change the world.
You kill the whole movie when the accent isn't respected. There's a movie where Halle  Berry was speaking Xhosa in Cape Town. Listen to me. I vomited. Blood.
There have to be African actors that can play the part. Cmon man 
What are you drinking sir 
Name 5 actors better than Denzel Washington. I am waiting.
I once had a pool party. None of the girls were swimming. It was a photo shoot. If you splashed water on peoples hair, it was armageddon.
Please. 
Send me 3.8 million or shut up 
Same joke you told 3 weeks ago and they're dead on the floor 
Your jokes hit different when you're the one buying the booze.
The banks are now offering finance to graduates with no credit history... for a car. Not for business or a house. Fishy stuff.
Soon as I stop spending the girls disappear. So I don't stop.
I appreciate it. Thank you 
Man kisses violently 😂😂😂 He said 😡😘 
Have as much sex as you can before your stuff stops working without the intervention of medicine. I am wisdom.
I've been through 3 divorces. If you're reading this, do not get married. It's an exercise in futility.
I'm a heterosexual male. But thank you. 
Bad breathe is a top 3 turn off. Everything can be 100 but if your mouth smells like bedroom abortions, I can't help you.
I'm a boring old man. Dont expect jokes and backflips 
I do not understand how David Kau made it in that career. The man is not funny. He makes me feel sad.
Black people are forever complaining. Always playing the victim. And they are openly racist.
I'm 71 years old so seeing pictures of naked girls floating down my phone is extremely mind blowing. Pictures of bums were illegal when I was a boy.
What are these things 
All my kids are grown up and I'm divorced. I need company for xmas. Preferably black. Not over 25. I'm willing to pay up to R4500 for 10 hrs of your time. Please spread the word. Thank you.
I enjoy the company of young black women.
I'm 71 years old and I still can't say the word 'sex' around my parents.
Do you believe in ancestors? Yes or no
Wow. Ageism. Might I kindly remind you that oak trees provide Oxy OXYGEN 
Is it just me or is life a scam?
Nothing trump tweeted has aged well.
This is really pathetic and disgusting. I mean if you're going to record anything keep your bloody hands steady. That's one job. One. 
You will not make it in life with a negative attitude. I'm not saying smile even though you're in a shitty situation. I'm saying it ain't over till it's over. Perseverance is everything.
Lord please hear this prayer. Amen 
As a caucasian, I fully endorse this message of unseasoned foods. 
Is it just me or does marriage sound like torture?
Guys who dance like at clubs always go home alone smelling like expired armpits. Alone. 
Seafood &gt;&gt; 
I'm 71 years old and I still cant drink around family from my mothers side.

I'm not tweeting bout anyone who isn't my spouse. 
As an old man that's been around I can safely tell you that they dont mind this question if they already like you. 
Can't wait till I have the typa money to make a girl tattoo my name on her. Coz I certainly do not have the bomb dick to induce that level of dizziness in an adult human being.

Lool Good díck or as us grandpas call it: sexual intercourse. That will NOT give you a big booty or glowing skin. That's twitter logic. Go to gym, diet and bath. You're welcome.
Younger sibling on the way.. 
Just bath. Please. We gonn' cum on faces regardless but that ain't it. Bath with soap. Please. 
Let's keep it real. This one of the most famous  overhyped trash beats of all time. People quote this song only coz of that one line 
Ronaldo is on drugs. Expensive undetectable drugs.
Being ugly and broke in December is painful. I have no other word to better describe it. It is pain.
You should be smiling 
Have you watched the new Lion King yet?
Answer your phone I still love you. 
Have the in the 2020 im... tweets started yet? I can't see any. Maybe the people I'm following are tired of life.
Don't cheat on your boyfriend for nothing just because its december. I'm paying. 50% before, the rest after.
I don't turn to alcohol or food when my hearts been broken tbh. I turn to Jesus. The true healer. After I'm fixed I'm back to chasing women that'll destroy me again.

Bosy wants sex. Heart wants love. Bank account wants money.

You guys are really having sexual intercourse with people you met on twitter? I'm playing neh
Why do girls steal please? Hoodies, face wash, our hearts. What's next? Sperm? I'm disgusted 
My ex sent me a picture of a positive pregnancy test on the 1st of April 2014. I shat my pants. Took me 30 mins to figure out the date.

Vintage chinks coming up. Lemme think of more stupid fire shit to tweet 
I promise you I was at a party last night and this girl called 50 cent the guy from Power  I requested her ID immediately and niggas laughed. You dont know fifty? Foh
50 Cent literally dissed the whole of bikini bottom. For years. Constantly. Not tha shit Kendrick did on control. One verse? 50 was on niggas heads. Crippled Ja Rule. Who was thee biggest rapper at that time. Crippled
You stole this tweet from the bible. 
I cant imagine giving birth. A get a flu and I start re-writing my will. Ready to meet my Lord and saviour fr.
You watch any MJ concert and you realise that nigga wasn't a celebrity. He was a god. Grown niggas fainting in his presence? Ah. Lol that's magic
How long have you had your current mobile number? I'm celebrating 10 years on the same number 🎁
I wont lie. Girls that drink hansa or milk stout scare me.

Programming is not mathematics. It requires the same logical skill to be good at it. But it is not math. 
Y'all remember when they said pokemon was demonic? 
These swines dont reply tho so masturbaecation it is for me. 
Timbaland gave niggas hit after hit. From Jayz to Justin Timberlake. I remember.
Drinking and driving ain't it man. Either find a sober driver, drink at home or dont drink. Swine.
The hate for Drake is real. You can call that dude a pop start all you want. He can rap. Like he flows on beats like its nothing.
Good for her. Cant be dating toxic people 
Sex after marriage &gt;&gt; 
You can literally play Get Rich Or Die Tryin from beginning to end. That album sound like it came out 4 years ago. Its 19 years old. 19.
Girls: I need a boyfriend 😭 Guys: hey there  Girls: 
This is sick. Dating younger men who aren't emotionally mature enough to make their own decisions yet so they can groom and control them. Women🚮 
Who was your favourite pokemon?
I hope all the girls not wearing a full panty have a great day.
Gnight to the queens with size 6 or less feet ❤  As for the rest of you mafias. Smh.
she will save the avengers  Iron Man dies and she busy flying around aimlessly like a moth. Useless as a public holiday on a Saturday 
And you'll only then just realise that she was never yours to begin with. That's when the chest pains kick in harrd 
you look like a clown my love 
I'm going Saturday 
Sperm banks are paying R750 for ya cum. Getting paid to masturbate. Stop dumping ya kids on tissues and get this cheque
hey I only want to smash is the fastest way  to the land of masturbation 
Can you believe the mcflurry was once R18. This world is truly sick.
Giving her those lil gentle neck kisses then sinking your teeth into her skin and drinking her blood❤
This is so true hey 💯 People sleep under bridges and eat from dustbins coz they want to. Those idiots. 
I like how girls complain that we stop putting in effort after we start dating em. As if they dont start wearing Puma tracksuit, helmet and full panty to bed. Smh
So I'm the only guy that steals money from his gf's purse? How d'you guys survive
I dont want my kids to be spoilt brats same time i dont want em growing up hard. Just in between. They get playstations on their birthdays but they shower in cold water every day. In between.
These girls dont even breakup with you anymore they jus start wearing full panties everyday.
That's extreme 
How does one become an ancestor? That's my question
VAR removed the excitement and thrill from the beautiful game. All the controversy of late winner goals that shouldn't have been. Gone
Gnight to all the sexually frustrated girls.

Have you ever awkwardly walked in on some1 while they're dressing or using the toilet?
Know your lane. If you're a 2, shoot your shots at 5s. Nothing higher. The only way to shoot at anyone outta your range is if you're monied. It's in the bible.
I've been trying to put on my contact lenses for the last 40 mins. Do I need to sacrifice a goat to the gods to get these shits in
Thank you ever so kindly 
If the baby isn't yours 🔥😭 
Some women wear a bra to bed? Isn't that satanism
You actually need to be close with atleast 2-3 barbers. This thing of being loyal to 1 doesnt work. Especially fridays.
Smashing your friends ex is not only desperation its disrespectful. There's no reason you should be with my ex if you're ok upstairs. This real life not Greys Anatomy
Ok on a serious note. If a Muslim girl dies a virgin shes waking up be smashed by Abdullah the 74 year old suicide bomber? Sounds like a raw deal
If I was a woman I'd get pregnant yearly just to get maternity leave and chill at home then sell the baby to Angelina Jolie when it arrives. Y'all sleep
I know I'm depressed when I pee sitting down.
Sounds like programming. 
That video on the tl of what looks like 5 year olds having sex on the street is what's wrong with the Earth. Just rotten
Your mom thinks you're wholesome but you used to send Indian men bobs and vagne
This is extremely important. If you're going to take a shit in a place other than your house, you gotta make sure there's water enough to flush at least twice.
I hate being tickled. Dont even know how people can enjoy torture like that.
Bumping into people from high school is annoying . hey you still alive??  No this is a hologram Einstein
I run faster in my birthday suit 
It's people who can't be happy alone that make others miserable.
They're people who don't sleep naked? Y'all some weird humans
I watched this once and immediately knew the cable guy is smashing his wife. No other explanation 
You know she's angry at you when you get a goodnight text at 17:46
Imagine takin a girl out and she spend half the time takin pics of her sunglasses placed next to her cider and ribs platter for IG. Like can you stop being a hoodrat for just 14 mins
I like how girls set the rules for a friends-with-benefits at the beginning i jus want a physical relationship nothin more  Loool 2 weeks later she caught feelings. Leaving 8 missed calls @2am talkin bout ?? on whatsapp
Nobody:  a hoe: i dont usually do this hey
Being ugly growing up really does build character. Rejection is standard. Being hated coz you ugly is standard. By the time you're an adult, you're stronger than Samson with afro. You've seen it all.
Religion is toxic.
My mom is addicted to crime documentaries. If not that its Judge Matthews.
I just need a girl to deeestroy my heart. Creative juices start flowing soon after 
It's not your fault king. If she wants to be a slave in the name of love that's on her 
If you've ever played soccer in your younger days and there were girls around... niggas wouldn't pass the ball. Defender tryna dribble the whole team coz his fat ass gf is screaming when he touches the ball smh
human Twitter is so active they literally copy n paste tweets and they go viral everyday. 154k RTs on a stolen tweet you saw 2 days ago.
Proof that white people aren't creative 
Unfollowed all the fake people on my list so if you're seeing this, you're a real one ❤ Send me money
If petty had a face 
It don't cost no money to salute or congratulate someone for their achievements man. Y'all niggas act like y'all gotta pay to show people love.
I cant wait to get into another toxic relationship, get my heart torn apart again and start dropping fire misogynistic tweets❤
This was so therapeutic to watch 
Wednesday is my birthday. Set a reminder. Send me money. That's all. Thank you.

Kanye literally released a song called Big Brother directed towards Jay where he addressed and explained their initial beef clearly. Asskissing and apologizing basically. And Jay didnt show up to the wedding..

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Mutuals on fire off the shoulder of SJW Twitter. I watched oomfies glitter in the dark near the N-word Towers.  All those moments will be lost in time, like... tears in rain.  Time to get suspended. 
Let that sink in. how about I just fucking kill you how about that.
This is the shittest form of comedy on this website. 
Thank you for your take, rich celebrity. 
It can't be that easy. It's that easy. 
I really hope we see more of Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Waking up the other day and having this be the opening scene was surreal.   Prequel fans that grew up with these movies are winning. 
Over 131,000 people have never picked up a comic book in their lives and it shows.  Ivy doesn't want humans to exist so nature can rule. But yes, cheer for the girlboss because she has a girlfriend! (Who she beats)

Darth Vader has killed Imperial officers for failing him once.  Yet Reva, who has failed multiple times, and even tried to KILL HIM, was left alive? Is there a character with bigger plot armor in Star Wars at the moment?

Four stills from a film you believe is a masterpiece. No title. 
Top Gun: Maverick is a faultless sequel. It's filled with feel good moments, heart, and incredible intensity.  It's a true legacy sequel that offers so much, and is well worth the watch.

Hence forth, you shall be known as... Drip Vader. 
People crying about the Iron Giant's inclusion in MultiVersus are dumb tbh.  It's a silly fighting game in which Shaggy goes Super Saiyan and Bugs Bunny gets into a fist fight with Batman.
So there's a part where he puts a rat in a woman's vagina and tortures her graphically. It's pretty funny and grotesque.   Let me read you the passage he wrote about the African human on the wall.

I hope it's a bait-and-switch, but even if DC are making Bruce Wayne bisexual, it does not matter. No one has taken comics seriously for years because they exist to fuel the writer's wants and ego. They are not writing to serve a good story.

I'm not sold on this game. Travelling around Gotham, the combat, and the story missions all seem odd.  Slow, clunky and lacking the heart and drive of the Arkham Games that overshadow it.  Plus cancelling the PS4 and Xbox One version is weird.

So, Barry Keoghan's Joker in The Batman.  I like his performance. This look doesn't work for me. It tries too hard to one-up The Dark Knight's scarred Joker, and this comes across as just revolting.   Joker shouldn't be a hideous freak. I miss The Clown Prince of Crime.

It's the first anniversary of Zack Snyder's Justice League.  I was always a DC kid. I remember the sheer disappointment after seeing the 2017 Whedon/WB disaster.  Finally seeing Zack Snyder's vision was amazing, and his trilogy would've been a modern epic. 
My father was... a Sneeder.

No thanks. 
So, maybe The Flash got delayed a year because they saw the backlash to them erasing Snyderverse? I'm all for restoring it. I liked Snyder's plans for a JL trilogy. It seemed very Lord of the Rings and a Crisis event. 
I hate release dates. Just reveal the game when it's in a good spot, not when you've just decided to start it.  So tiring in the video game industry seeing rushed games, or delay after delay.  It's out when it's out. Stop edging. 
It's such an odd trend that Hollywood replaces redheads with pocs 
Lmfao this movie is never coming out 
For Kenobi's limited series, it really needs to be stellar.  This is the last time we'll see McGregor as Obi-Wan and Christensen as Anakin/Vader together. It has to be a perfect farewell for such a huge part of our childhoods. Growing up, these guys were Star Wars. 
The sheer amount of cope from Western game developers about Elden Ring is astounding.  Why are they so jealous of an original ip's staggering success? Remember that these people don't make games for you. They hate what you enjoy.

Weird, wasn't this the rumoured premise for JOKER 2?   Dafoe would do great against Phoenix. They're great actors for what JOKER did.  However, he's too old to be Pattinson's Joker, and I feel like it would just be a another rendition of his Green Goblin (great role).

I like Sam Raimi, and I like Doctor Strange.  But to me, Multiverse of Madness seems like an unnecessary effort to nostalgia bait old, insignificant Marvel movies. Affleck's Daredevil, Fox's X-Men, Snipes' Blade.  It's too much. This isn't a movie it's a cameo-extraviganza.

As for the monthly Sam and Frodo debate, if you think they're gay you have no interest in LOTR. You just want to indulge in homo-erotic fantasies, and it shows you've never had a best friend that you'd do anything for.

Tom Holland's Peter Parker is finally Spider-Man.  No longer is he Iron Boy Jr. He finally had the responsibility Spidey should have. Everyone in this movie, from the villains to the heroes felt like they wanted to be there, and knew this was an event.  Really enjoyed it. 
Going to see No Way Home in a few hours. I hope this film redeems Holland's attempt at Spider-Man, as so far I think he has no redeemable qualities that make him Peter Parker other than actual high school kid.

To all that Parag Agrawal has suspended, I hope you come back soon.  If you don't? It's been a good ride. 
Went from 3,200 followers to 2,928.  What the fuck just happened?
I got the platinum trophy in Sekiro last night.  That marks a plat for each FromSoft title (Except 2).  Already miss the combat. Any recommendations?

Rise and shine anon 
Saw House of Gucci. Very long story but entertaining if you don't know about the whole ordeal.   Pacino and Gaga really stole the show, best scenes were with those two. 
Gm anon 
Cactus Jack sent me!!!! 
Woah!! Cool knife left in my car from a thief! hurhurhur 
I completed all 4 Sekiro endings.  What an absolute great game. The combat never bored me. It was so fun and satisfying. Each fight got easier and easier to the point where the last 3 bosses were done flawlessly.   Loved this game. FromSoft don't miss. 
Evil dies tonight. 
Isn't supposed to be good what is it then? Another product for people to consume?   Was it made as an insult to the anime? Stupid article.

So, MOTU: Revelation Part II.   Anyone who actually watched it can you tell me what happens? I'm not interested in investing time in a show that stomps on He-Man.

Been playing a lot of Sekiro.  Curious to see what you guys think of it? It's very different to Dark Souls, I find it frustrating at times, but I'm enjoying it. 
This has the same energy of that post that went viral about national rape day or some dumb shit. Lmfao

Anyone seen Ghostbusters: Afterlife yet?  What are your thoughts?
Accessing FBI crime statistics. 
When you're black, you can't just go to the police and say you're being blackmailed. They'll just confirm: Yes sir, you are black, and you are a male. Is that a knife? 
Doctor Strange saying Scooby Doo this crap gave me whiplash for how fucking bad that line was. 
Thank you for 3,000, guys. Pretty cool actually. Thanks for all who helped make it happen.  Don't exactly know what to post to top the pic below.

Family Feud in a nutshell 
Twitter wild for this one 
This film is the perfect continuation of the original movie.   It has all the elements of Ghostbusters, and the third act is stellar. This is a movie for the fans, and if you like Ghostbusters, definetely check it out.   I hope this film does well and this is just the beginning. 
Johnny Silverhand on Xbox? 
Keep your society. 
Morpheus is just like me. Can be and wear anything in the virtual words and goes Joker mode. 
I'm really excited to see Ghostbusters: Afterlife tomorrow.  I've been waiting for a continuation for what feels like forever. I was so attached to the video game, that was my perfect Ghostbusters 3.  I hope this film gives the fans what they deserve after so long. 
What the fuck?? 
Womp womp. 
Accidents happen.  Corporations need to stop shaming us. 
This movie needs to dismantle Spider-Man and stop giving him such an easy life. Hopefully NWH does that.  Kill Ned, Aunt May and MJ, bring back responsibility, and most importantly: give us Tobey Maguire babyyyyy. 
Go back to the bathroom and take a shit. I can smell you!  Go to the bathroom, I can smell you shitting yourself. Get up and go to the bathroom now!  GO TO THE BATHROOM!   You're shitting yourself, poop is coming out of your fucking asshole!

Ridley Scott: they're mostly saved by special effects.  This guy proves his point by showing a boring CGI fight. 
Winning the Emmy for this ratio 
Netflix are really great at advertising why you shouldn't watch their movies 
Being unable to discuss things you don't like or have negative opinions of makes you boring.  Just admit your brain can't handle a conversation that doesn't involve product good. 
Another platinum means not knowing what to play next. 
Red Dead Redemption II is everything I could have wanted from a western game.  This Platinum was time consuming, but I wanted to give everything, in return for what it offered me.  I think we're about done, my friend... 
This format is going to make me go Elliot Rodgers mode

Love of my life. 
I saw Eternals. (No I didn't pay for it)  It exceeded my expectations for being WORSE than I possibly thought it could be.  The dialogue and characters are so unmotivated and wooden.  This is one of the most uninspired films I've seen, even for Marvel standards. 
It took about a month, but we're out of 2,700 and into 2,800.  Moving up again with all you frens with me.

Why do liberals fear Chris Pratt...  Is it because he's a successful man of God? Or his drive for a better body? Maybe because he's happily committed to his wife and children?  It's utter cope and seethe for all of them.

Can't wait for the headlines when the next Marvel movies show a character shitting in a toilet for the first time or something.  It will be revolutionary for the MCU!

Once again I am moving to a different state. 
Hello. 
I really liked Halloween Kills. I've never been into slayers, and still don't really care about Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and others.  But something about Michael Myers was really fun and captivating.
I've waited my entire life for this 
Decided to see Halloween Kills at the cinema tonight.  I don't really get the negative reviews. The hospital stuff was boring, but it was a lot of fun seeing Michael Myers just having a wild night murdering people.Everyone is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody.

god damnit cat 
fed could lern something from luna instead of  QuAnTItaTiVE EaSiNG

gg chimpzoo 
flies when seeing my open window 
dis is the tiem u realise ur not a giftet investor u was jus rly lucky 
good thing about buying $looks at the top is it has been capitulating for months now  u cant hurt me im used to this

im down a shitload but i know one person thats down worse  come here michael u silly goose haha   there there sh sh 
u can still act as if u have 100x as much as u actually have with 100x leverage just saying

fkn gensler was right
anyone remember this 'inovative' algo stable coin that was pegged to 50 cents instead of 1 usd that that was the innovative part lmao
donalt going full tweet mode  love to see it  let the copytrading of duck commence 
on a more positive note  if ur new and u lost today just try not to quit  crypto will stay and u will have new possibilities in the future to make it all back and more
remember justin sun also 'had a plan' when he bought bit torrent lmao
should have known when justin sun said he might have a plan  dude made tron how gud of a plan could it have been
i mean yes its sad for the normies and newbies to get rekt af  but isnt that how literally all of us entered the space?  bc we got rekt but we stayed anyways?
at least the other coin do kwon made will be at 1 usd soon 
i dont think buying luna anytime soon for anything else then a ded cat bounce makes much sense  afaik the only reason luna exists is ust and ust is obvioulsy broken af rn
paid group soon 
$avax up 20% on the news that pepecasso sold the bottom 
lets jus peg ust to 90 cents imo
if i were still in ust id probably start exiting my position rn

every time i see a twitter post with a rick pfp im exited for a second before i realize its not rick
$eth went from 1400 to $85 while fundamentals didnt change   at the time it felt like they changed at least twice a day tho

Here's the thing  CT has never been correct about anything once in the history of ever  individual accounts take their W's here and there  but overall, the fact that all of CT concurs on 13keks  makes me doubt that that will be the bottom
You might say oh you wont date her because of her fake nails? how superficial  but it isn't, really, since if she isn't willing to compromise on something as trivial as fake nails, which I absolutely despise, it'd never work anyway  kittens are fine and wholesome tho

This is a wake up call to all the beautiful souls out there that I have walked away from because of your inability to shed your fake nails  hear my message! 
This market is like fake nails on a chalkboard
Down with the Fake Nail Elite
We must simply channel all our anger  frustration, sadness, despair, hopelessness  into rejecting fake nails in society  name a more productive use of it, pro tip u cant
I think we can all agree that we need something to blame for this market downturn  and that something  is fake nails
Give me the clean, feminine, round, organic, normal looking nails of an earthly, sensual, grounded, humble woman any day!  I like that!  Away with your fake nail wielding harlots in their caked clown make up and designer satchels full of harlequin's parlor tricks

Banged a dude so hard last nice  dude was screaming my name lol 
open to feedback  what do you chicks think 
idk what to call women anymore  call em lady it's old fashioned  call em chick it's kind of rude  call em girl it's creepy sounding  call em woman it's too formal  I go with chick it's the least of the evils ig
for example  send the chick you had over for some wine and deez last night to the gas station to get energy drinks while one watches RTS replays  if she gets angry and storms off? good, it's no loss!  if she gets the drinks? good. Tsssssss  Either way  I stay posted up 
I dont disagree lmao  based af take 
Idk why everyone always hates on laziness  there have been periods of my life where I've either had to work my ass off, or wanted to since it synergized with my goals  but I think laziness is a godpower it makes you see the absolutely maximally efficient thing everywhere
I am here to blast my own opinions into the metaverse  not hear those of others  🤝 
I probably have three arguments going on in my notfis rn  one about sugarfree being bad or not bad  one about gm being toxic or not  one about the cleanliness of shoes  I have pre-emptively muted them all

Okay I'll confess  I dont know what a loud pack is
I am always shocked when other people care about things I'm indifferent about  or when they're indifferent to things I think are awesome  because I'm always objectively correct so it's just kind of weird you know

what's the best sugarfree energy drink they have at gas stations  fuck sugar, sugar-free is my new best friend
tbh I really don't get why others would want to know what I think about their choice of apparel but I guess someone who buys clothes to impress others would care what others think that's the whole point  idk dude non-autists are weird to me lol 
I get interesting dms  esp on the main but here now too  why do you think designer clothes and watches aren't cool? - not asked in a bad way, but curiously  look if you actually have passion about watches, go for it I won't judge you at all  it's only when you think it's a flex
I'm seeing some sensible predictions out there  mine:  chop in this area for a bit, maybe 'lose' 20k for a day  pump to some number and consolidate there maybe 30k by august/september  lose it rapidly by november/december back to this area  break this area for true bottom lower
I need a gf so she can run to the gas station and pick up energy drinks for me while I watch RTS replays  I *am* the patriarchy
It’s that time of the market  WTB time  Bitty 13keke Et hirium 420 Doggy coin 1 cent Rune 30 cent  and some other stuff I havent found yet  if we get those prices I’ll deploy all remaining powder I have set aside, no matter when it happens or what the fud is

Inside you are two shibes 
Ive been thinking  youll all HATE this but  at a certain point it’s super tough to keep pumping crypto to crazy valuations  so maybe the ponzinomics solution  is to just dump them lower this time  so they can re-reach high lvls later for more x’s and stay attractive to big money
All said  They should absolutely not get bailed out  would be a retarded precedent for the space  would only encourage degeneracy at greater scale  luna, celsius, 3ac  will the blow ups be big enough to deter future stuff like this? idk  but justice&gt;mercy. cause and effect.
How does someone deal with this level of ego death  everyone knew about em  they lost more than we’ll see in a lifetime, many of us 10 fold+++ easily  they gonna become zen monks or something I dont even know 
Im a supremely unemotional guy  I rarely get nervous, tilted, scared, or feel up or down much  Ive never felt much my entire ct career  but I cannot even imagine what Su and Kyle are going thru  they rly did bring it on themselves - Im not simping  but I just cant even imagine
Yes but I have given up on trying to make people understand their hypocrisys  now I just talk about how angry and horny I feel  it’s more relatable

I literally feel nothing when my moneygon  but when I lose ELO on ranked ladder  I fall into a turbulent melancholy  the only thing that could possibly ressurect my sullen mood rn  is good pussy
Man I keep finding out that my crypto bros are actuallt beautiful women irl  and you know what  I like it
lmaoooo this  ELO and PNL are the same p much  I refuse to rage play when Im tired but wired from losing  Ill regain my cool and play later with cool rage 
Im done for the evening Ive lost enough ELO 
Its really strange  I lose tons of real money in investments on paper and am calm as the buddha  I lose a game on ranked ladder and I get really toxic 
My neighbors hate me I get so angry  just a 31 y/o angry man yelling at the fat 16 year old korean kid beating me 
Just lost 5 games in a row on ranked ladder

I'm pretty sure if robots emerged and offered for people to get hooked into a Matrix in exchange for using their bodies for fuel  but everyone was guaranteed a life upgrade to what they have now  99% of people would not only say yes  but push hard to get first dibs
I think my main problem is I   &gt;Need to have supreme power over all major decisions in the relationship  &gt;am profoundly lazy  if either of these is disturbed I simply refuse to make it work  in other words I'm an asshole

HAY BROHS  yall herd abou dat contagion doe
The Pregnant Man Emoji Was the Top of all Risk Assets for the Entire Millenium
look at that bicep muscle tone  he would make such a good forager 
I will never get tired of the pregnant man emoji
What do you mean you make 500k/yr and you spend more than you make??  what about our child??? 
mfs like me who only began buying a bit at 29k and a bit more here, and who has always genuinely cautioned people to conserve capital will, of course, be sorted right into the bin of these guys who have lost everything and are saying it
remember to always have 3 years of expenses in the bank!  tweets a guy who was calling me a retard at 60k for selling, a retard at 48k for fading the LUNA daily buys and so forth  and is now down to his last 100 dollars and eating his own jizz for the prohtons 
I love how everyone that was bullish at the top and all the way fucking down is now tweeting remember to conserve capital and tweeting threads on it like they aren't completely broke and talking to themselves
intro music would be Mewny and me just saying bussy bus AYE bussy bus AYE bussy bus AYE bussy buy boah  together in unison  then the podcast starts

y'all should root for me to lose more money  if I lose enough money, even on paper, I'm starting a podcast!  woooo
Here's the thing  there is so much confluence from things I normally care about to buy here  but I'm done buying at this level, I'm not putting anymore in  because I dont have enough info to make a good decision about 3ac contagion and what's goin on  sentiment isn't everything
I am scared  and I am horny
I think Sam is winning the Game of Cones
Does anyone have a link to good information about the depth and breadth of contagion from 3ac  I understand info is just coming out, but I want sources that are empirical and do deep dives, with limited speculation  the threads I've read so far are mostly shallow follower grabs
I will step off the plane, smelling like economy class, and snifffff a deep breath and murmur  “Im here to impregnate egirls and tell them my name, and Im fresh outta my name” 
ahhh my neuronsss 
yo for the last time homies Im not in mars and I never will be lol I dont like mars  nothing against bikini bottomers themselves  and I dont care for most nfts either  if I go to a conf itd probably be miami or vegas or something  with the express purpose of seggs with egrills
What if the best actors in this space is and always have been goofy anons with silly pfps
Sifting through all the threads on 3ac contagion  yeah there’ll be more selling. But it seems sensationalist to me  the latest fud  I dont think it’s as bad for crypto as ppl make it out to be  money will step in to replace what they were doing over time  bp hikes r worse
thhat was a good ama sesh  alright brohs, female brohs, beloved egirl simps and all in between  gnussy 
ah yeah I can already see all the good questions for baked che 
alright fine quick blazed ama  ask anything you wish  this is some pretty weird weed and I have pierced the veil of our reality  Ill check questions in 10 standard earth minutes
anyways back to that semi-hiatussy
fwiw I doubt 20kekesis gonna break meaningfully for at least 4 months  maybe a stab or two for liquidity…  I think we bounce next I really do 
yes I mean Im competitive as fuck lol  insanely, overbearingly so  but sometimes I get the urge to go a lil extra aggro  but man it is really worth it when I channel that energy into constructive and positive stuff instead 
We done dumpin for now?
Im baked btw
I will say that on balance, over time, this is true not only of the market, but of life  you may want to unleash the juicy insult  give in to some unwholesome temptation  w/e  but over time karma really will sort things  it’s not some active divine hand imo  it’s cause and effect 
I guess I dont “regret it” tbh  staying wholesome is, overall, wholesome 
I will say that after I began resisting unleashing cruelty here to stay wholesome af  my elo on ranked ladder went up 100 points  thats where it goes now 
Man when my life gets hard  I really regret my decision to stop cyberbullying people  why am I so sadistic in the metaverse I dont understand  why does bullying others feel so good  anyway I must stay on the path of light and continue to emit only the best vibes
all u mfs fudding tether  stop fudding the hand that feeds us all
it is objectivly pronounced la croy  but I say La Cwah
sometimes I see something so wholesome I bellow WHOLESOME AF irl
I was the sophmore smoking human Spirits wearing the glassjaw t shirt who would only listen to Circa Survive and prompt chicks to ask me about glassjaw  what do u think about glassjaw che? they'd ask  It sucks, I just wear the t-shirt  anyways back to Hiatus
terrible grammar in my tweets idc 
When I was your kids' age I listened to Mr. Brightside by The Killers and I thought man this shit is deep
the one and only artist I liked that zoomers liked was Lil Peep  Rest in peace, Lil Peep, we hardly knew ye 
yuh yuh yuh yuh  yuh? yuh?  yuh. yuh.  *boom  bom booom boooom  bom booom boooom  yuhhh yuh yuh yah yah  pussy go crazyyyy  *tss tsssss tsssss...  - How zoomer music sounds to me 
at the rate music on the radio is deteriorating in 5 yrs its just gonna be bass drum, trap and some goofy ass mf saying “yuh yuh”
imagine not being naturally handsome ngmi 
can u spot the humblebrag I think I hid it p well but idk 
stuffed some kleenex to make the bulge bigger for good measure 
as a fit handsome tall man in my early thirties I am going to walk out to my ancient toyota wearing only my boxer briefs so I can drive to mcdonalds at 11:30pm for some nuggies I think that's not indecent exposure right I'm pretty sure technically it's legal
*looks out the window wistfully*  someday. 
anyway back to my mostly hiatus but imagine fading my rumbling nuts ngmi 
I see blithe hypocrisy and tone-deaf edge-bait everywhere I look today  Did you call the Luna thing? The celsius thing? this thing? that thing? cool, so did I and alot oc other people  enough grave dancing have some decorum 
Im pretty cynical, but overall I like most people  if I dont like u it means you really truly suck one  but at times like this the timeline really truly annoys me  y’all can just type up the grave dancing tweet and delete it  get ur 131 likes another way
I least I have La Cwah  Tssssss
If he’s taking a mostly-hiatus then so am I 
At least I have made a legacy on this world 
I think everywhere I look I see insane FUD about literally everything  so I'm turning off twitter   and I'm going to watch more Squidbillies  not financial, life, or television viewing advice 
if this is truly the end of crypto it'll be the first time it was the end of crypto that it actually was the end of crypto  and not a screaming buy opportunity  and although I feel extreme, extreme, insane fear in my heart  I feel powerful rumblings in my nuts 
ok so basically I bought at 29k  and I'm buying here  and I've got buys both lower  and much lower  but I'm never going all in   you want to know why?  bc I never go all in or all out and I need cash to pay bills and to stay chill  but tbh long term these have gotta be ok buys
I am blasted Starboy remixes, high asf, watching this chart teeter on the edge  you may not like it  but this is what peak male etc etc
that's what I'm talking about lol  like I think I put on a inverse perp usdc short on bybit with a smol amount jsut for fun  it'd have been back up at 48  but bybit isn't up so I can't check  I really doubt it's up I probably closed that shit 
bybit must be down or something  anyways I doubt it's there I never short or long perps with any size anyway it would have just been to fuck around  I doubt it's still on tbh 
it would have been a small one for the lols at like 48 because I was really dang sure it was going to nuke  I would have been high when I put it on too  loggin in now 
wait a sec I think I might have put on a cheeky short on bybit months ago that I never closed lemme check
Can we just get this damn dump over with so I can sleep lol  can I get that mercy at least
Now at least we can see which of the egirls like me for my personality and not my money
Dat Oedipussy Complexussy 
that's lowkey what I'm afraid of fr  we puke to 15k or something and just chop between 12 and 18 for 8 grueling months with no relief  not saying that happens, but mannnnnnnn  that'd really clear out alot of the fair weather crypto ppl 
me n who 
go on, Sam  Let me feel the POWER of your THUUM 
If this bish gets to like 16k and eth to 700 or something today I'm just buying bigly I dont even give a shit anymore  I'll keep enough cash on hand so I dont have to get a job and can keep shitposting but beyond that it's all going in baby
aight I got some STANKY bids set up  bring it on Sam show us your power
I cant sleep my net worth is dying 
pretty sure ftx limiting stink bids is their fancy way of saying prepare your anooos
Alright Im going to watch Squidbillies then sleep  tomorrow if we’re under 20kussy  I will feel pretty deprussy
you guys are so lucky Im here to talk about random shit while everyone except me is tearing each others heads off  I coulda been on Hiatus you know
ik ik  I dont disagree  it sucks  if we get a recession… crypto has never experienced such a thing before  keep some cash for groceries brohs 
having mfs call me stupid will never not happen when Im about to be firmly right 
like idk maybe we scythe down low for a lil bit  but there has never been a time that bitty didnt respect the 200 weekly movingussy  nor a time btc has cracked its former cycle low  occams razors say we hold the 200 weekly, at least first pass  but everyone scared as hell rn
What if we gigapump the moment Powell says 75
I give this a moderate chance of having happened  what conspiracy theory isnt turning out true these days  you kinda have to expect the worst in this space I hate to say it 
I am once again telling you that I am baked
oh on g? 
“I’m so bulliish on crypto it’s a new paradigm. We’ll finally resist tyranny together as one! - guy down 97%  “wtf is ‘distributed ledger’ lol just kidding idc” - guy up 40,000,000%
time for an early bed  so I can wake up tomorrow and stunt aha
things I touch  &gt;boobies 
things I dont touch  &gt;privacy &gt;daos &gt;jizzcoins &gt;most nfts &gt;most defi &gt;exchange coins &gt;things with teams I dont trust &gt;algo-stable pumpcoins &gt;things I dont understand
I wont on principle as I always diversify  but it would probably work  I literally think buying a fuckload of doge at 1 cent and setting a sell at $1 and checking in 5 years is the closest thing to a guaranteed 100x that exists 
my 5 positions going into the next cycle down the road  btc, eth, doge, ?, ?  and maybe I'll just scalp btc here and actually just have 5 alt coins in the next cycle in which case it'd be  ?, eth, doge, ?, ?  and Idk about eth so it could be  ?, ?, doge, ?, ? tbh
I'm pretty sure the alts I'll be loading up on haven't been made yet
Why yes I ignore text messages how could you tell 
Here is my policy on Texting  I reserve the right to   &gt;ignore any text I want &gt;get replied to instantly  if anyone get pissy with me about either of these Idc
My altcoin wishlist:  I wish I knew which altcoins to buy 
The only things I still look forward to:  &gt;Resident Evil 4 Remake &gt;Kotor Remake &gt;7th book in the Siege of Terra series &gt;Playing through Ocarina of Time with my Children &gt;The Peace and Tranquility of Divorce once I marry
I've thought about this for a long time  and after immense deliberation  I have concluded  that everyone is irrational but me
Touchin down in LA on Thursday wyd @liifesaver1
I got four kids on the way man hurry this relief rally the f up 
would u smoke with him 
I dont think it's impossible we someday get a zhupercycle  bitty would have to become global reserve or something tho  but that could happen  it'd be terrible for the world  but good for my wallet  bussy bus AYE
cheeeeeee I hate my jobbbb. my life sucksss. I'm not going to do anything about it. that movie sucks. that band sucks. that artist sucks. that book sucks  I DONT CARE 
life alpha  cut whiners out of your life  you don't need to surround yourself with people who bitch and moan about nothing all the time  find people that are fun to be around and have a good outlook
I love being in my thirties  I've already failed at being 30 under 30 so there's no pressure
bussy bus AYE
I'm pretty sure the rules of dating is that only one person can be thinking about the other at any given time  so if you thinkin about her anon?  it's over for u

Ive made trillions in this market and still dont understand what blockchain is
I dont know but the zoomers seem to respond to it 
Gary Genslussy 
Hearing about the 3ac insolvency  idk if it's true but damn  I dont really know what to say if it is  one thing is for sure though, tis better to have risen to blinding heights and then fallen  than be the wojak making fun of them behind a screen from his mom's attic
My brain is INTJ  My nuts are ESTP 
on the left - me watching a chart for 12 hours  on the right - me listening to banal conversation for 2 minutes 
from what I've read ENTJs are the most introverted of the extroverts  I have oft wondered if I am actually ENTJ  but probably not I definitely prefer being alone to in groups 80% of the time 
Is dat yor dug  whaoh  whos a cyort porpor 
INTJs be like  ah right Im in public I better animate my face so it looks like Im having genuine reactions to normiefodder
Everytime I try to trade on Coinbase's new Advanced Trading thing  do u want to do dark mode  bitch just make dark mode the default stop asking me
As someone that is literally always naked in my own home, getting FaceTimed gives me heart palpitations because I'm afraid they see my wang I still dont understand how it works but I think they might just insta-see you before you accept the call 
I'm pretty sure everyone has that one friend that you never text because they'll always instantly call you
sometimes if fooo doesn't like one of my tweets I get scared he's angry with me and he might block me  I know he never unblocks  then I remember  I'm him
plenty  I'm more frugal than a mfer  my life is cashflow positive anyway  take what I need from walmart  haggle my rent down to zilch and get hella referals to where i'm netting income  I could even airbnb if I need to 
people always ask che what is your secret  I only listen to my nutsack about everything  nothing and no one else
My nuts will know them when they meet them 
to be clear I'm not deploying all my dry powder here not remotely  I'd think about going like 85% all in at 13kussy, not just on bitty but on eth and alts, especially fresh alts
my nuts would be positively RUMBLING at 13kussy 
Honestly it's very possible we don't bounce at all lol  we literally slog along between 13 and 22 kekes for an 8 month accumulation  then pump out in early 2023  lmao can you imagine ze smells?
when my nuts tingle this hard I tend to blv them 
Idk guys my balls are tingling pretty hard I think I'ma buy a bit more here actually
I dont use tradingview I literally check coingecko's price and then imagine how the chart looks and draw it on paint
it's not about me keeping more  it's about them having less 
I could be 21 figs and I would still steal from Walmart and use coupons
I refuse to pay for Tradingview  and I refuse to accept their offer to give it to me for free  I will continue to use the free no account version and get angry when it periodically prevents me from seeing the chart, and prompts me to sign up  🤝
I just checked the chart for the first time since November when I saw it was 69k and lol'd and sold my whole position.  Looks alot lower now. I think I will set some bids on my way to the beach 
I will kektinue averaging dussy no matter how lussy bitcussy gussys 
if we go down to 16kussy I'll buy more and bring the CCBB to 20kekes 
I'm going to start a fun tweet series called Che's Cost Basis on Bitty  CCBB  Current CCBB is around 24.5k now (some at like 29 and some here)
I think Celsius is done-zo if even if they dont get liq'd   like at a certain point it's no longer worth it shorting more to try and reach a liquidity pocket of only such size so it probably doesn't get touched imo  but their trust is gone  once they re-open withdraws it's boop!
I think even if we dont bounce here  you cant really say it was bad RR  it’s the 200 weekly moving avg and prior cycle top on btc  I really dont think anyone honest could fault you for some spot buys here   imagine having not and it goes up 
Hope we get dat v bussy off dat 200 weekly mussy haha
today the real testussy of that 200 week movinv averagussy
Gmussy aha
Wen u scroll the timeline and see my “condom sex worse than” tweets sprinkled thru 🤌
Condom sex more masturbatory and redundant than Justin Sun’s tweets
Condom sex more disconcerting than a backhanded compliment
Condom Sex worse than when the wolves find ur tent
Condom Sex a greater waste of time and fluids than wandering the Sahara
Condox sex more stressful than engine troubles on a freeway
Condox sex worse than getting audited
Condom sex feels like when u try so hard and get so far but in the end it doesnt even matter
Condom sex more depressing than Requiem for a Dream
Condom sex worse than cleaning
Condom sex is the feeling of being a genetic dead end
Condom sex worse than the new matrix
Condom sex worse than the flu
Condom sex worse than when u drive to the grocery store, get all ur items, ready to check out, then realize u left ur wallet at home
Condom sex worse than sitting next to the sickest mf on the airplane
Baked Tweet 8: Condom Sex is worse than Listening to Nails on a Chalkboard for 15 minutes
Sequoia was already blowing up my phone even before I finished the tweet 
fuck to earn  validators fuck each other   proof of fuck  something something  seed money  I think Ive said enough to raise at least 100 million in this space already here
I would feel 50x more safu holding a basket of retarded dog coins than a basket of retarded boob coins
Im also not bullish simpdaos or porn coins anymore  I dont think we need boobs on the blockchain  I dont think the tech adds anything even insofar as the weakest narrative could be spun around it
Im personally not bullish privacy coins  the key to pumping in this market is not to be the thing you think is going to anger the gubirnmints  but the thing you think will puzzle the gubirnmints
Guevoblin Capital will be acquiring lots of doge and shiba inu when doge is at 1 cent in early 2023  I think the puppy coin sector can really take off  retards love that stuff
Most of your favorite coins are already dead anon they just dont know it  just sayin  better to long new, fresh, unpumped stuff to load up on for next cycle, preferably within the correct new paradigm
This 3% bounce has convinced me that going lower is mathematically impossible in this new paradigm
its just gonna be doge  all money sucked into doge 
Baked Tweet 6:  What is the next cycle’s narratibe  2017 was ICO  2021 was DeFi  2025 is what  too early to say?  what is getting built rn
Baked Tweet 5:  Do you guys think Les Goh is looking for a job rn?
I think the coingecko is enjoying all of this
definitely gave me a strong sense of detachment to the superfluous things.   gave me a strong sense of self confidence  lessson would be: the worse the hell the greater the strength one gains if one wins   I fear nothing now lol 
sure  when I was young I had atrociously bad ocd  massively life hindering. Insane suffering. Indescribable. Laughable to think it could be described if u dont have it.  didnt want to take meds. basically overrode compulsions with will. I win or I die kinda thing. won out slowly 
Why do they even HAVE a head of Nuking?? 
wagmi??  WAGYU 
Why do you think I poor LARP  the moment the ladies sniff that I have money they will try to change me 
Baked Che might have to make more appearances 
Im sorry but Justin Sun is the funniest thing on CT  “Well done!”  He could be floating through a matter-less void, outside of space and time  and he’d say “well done” to himself
Based on my fuckboy -level understanding of quantum physics  which is high  everything is definitely pre-determiner we only experience it as linear since we inhabit dis third dimensionerino 
Steady lads  deploying more baked tweets
Head of Nuking at Celsius’ Name is literally Duke Nukem
I will never not love this space
Whats her porn name   asking for myself 
Baked Tweet 4: Y’all ever play that remake of Myst?  Shit was dope
Baked tweet 3:  I think one of the most fascinating aspects of being human  is studying biopsychology  knowing the urges we will feel as we age and mature  seeing the biologically-induced ideas take shape in the mind  insidiously and gradually
I have not yet succumbed to the horny and went out and just mafe bebes  I am a calculated individusl  but everyday the horny grows stronger  and everyday my resolve weakens 
Baked Tweet 2:  I think about being born in the past… all the suffering there would be without, say, modern medicine  but it’d be worth it to have a harem fulla hoes fr
I am having the munchies  is this why munje is called “munch”  is it a subtle allusion to her being a hippy stoner
Baked tweet 1:  Do you guys wonder if they invented time travel in the future and they came back to long crypto early, creating buy the pressure we needed to catch on?
generally turn my phone off prior to getting baked  but tnite idc  ijdc 
I am baked
They all got one thing in common  I'm the father

Coinbase Price Alert:  Ethereum up 6%  Did you sell the bottom again, anon?
Just sent this to the hottest female in my whole phone  no text  she has yet to reply  so I'm gonna hit her with the hello???? 
I dont know Il Capo of Crypto but I've seen him bear posting and I have to admit he was really persistently calling for lower kekes all gas no breaks and it happened the way he said  saw him catch a ton of hate and flack all the way  he deserves clout for it 
I have bids filling now and more at Celsius' liq  I'm going to go smoke a j and blast some wyds  I dont even except to have seggs tonight  I just enjoy blasting wyds
my filled bids at 29k didn't stop it from going lower dont worry 
ok I'm bidding a bit here  it's the 200 weekly memeing average AND the previous bitcoin ATH I kind of have to
my opener on Hinge dates 
Debbie Thornberry from the Wild Thornberrys is definitely a busty milf now
Satoshi should send all his million bitcoins to increase Celsius’ collateral
Literally posted up on this couch rn watching old rick and morty and refreshing blockfolio  (as a shy millionaire with a big ass dick)

“oh u added 5k cones to margin?  oh on g?” 
to everyone dm’ing asking if Im at mars  nope I have no interest in crypto conferences generally and mostly scant interest in nfts  and I dont like mars  if I go to a conference it’ll probably be to have seggs with some of my egirl simps but I will tell you if I go
and by everyone I mean Hardwood 
ive never seen boku no pico but literally everyone on ct says it is amazing should I watch it
the floors at MACdonals 
Man tbh idk  this is such a strong area for a bounce  20k AND the 200 weekly memeing average  Can they REALLY push it down to the Celsius liq idk
somethin u can play wid 
DM me. 
If DN gets liq'd it gon be a real mess fr
All you guys talking about Celsius Liq this  Saylor Liq That  No one is asking about Liq'ing DN but that'd be the biggest blow up of them all
The real story is about what it gon take to liq DN 
Does anyone know Saylor's liq  what are all the relevant liqs rn
it keeps going lower  there's gonna be an inflection point at which the game theory for waiting to buy is no longer good and it actually gets defended  dunno if it reaches it though 
if you're down tremendous right now  just embrace the absurdity and laugh  laughter is the only thing that carried me through many such similar instances  a smol part of your psyche will break and then it's all gucci
I love this pfp
But yeah spot bids around this level will probably be fine at least for a bounce since we're now on/below the 200k weekly memeing average
How's our Bitt Coin that we put the house up against at $50,000 each doing honey? 
at a certain point bulls would be like eh there's no way it gets THAT low and start bidding 
I think Celsius would have to push dat liqerino below 10kekes to be utterly safu 
I am ngl I set a stink bid on 0.05 cents on a few exchanges for dat bitty
Think about Game Theory  what possible incentive is there for a whale looking to bid to try to defend Celsius' liq  just wait and bid after...  so they have no reason not to remove their bids now  one quick, tactical strike  but idk I'm just watching
Ooo dat capitulatioruni
to be clear, I doubt it  I really doubt it  but let's not lie to ourselves  it's possible 
very possible they are in cahoots and engineering liquidity to cover shorts at the bottom... 
I agree that is a possibility and it's p chilling 
I'm in such a good mood today  this whole week tbh  there's literally no reason to be  I'm just happy sort of people
I cannot, my love  because I'm busy cleaning 
Remember  the price is where it is because enough people blv the underlying situation is so bad that this is the fair price of dat bitty  doesn't mean it is  but I'm   well  idk what I'm saying I'm just tweeting out some garbage tbh
My plan is literally to bid Celsius' liquidation on Bitty and slorp some eth and alts at that price too  still preserving cash though  I have enough set aside to continue to shitpost indefinitely and that's how it gonna stay  never all in/out brohs  some set aside for 2023 also 
This capitulation is so clean  we even know where it will stop  Celsius' liquidation  we know everything
my soulmate out here 
Double Texting hello???? mere seconds after blasting a dumbass text is one of my top 5 favorite hobbies 
Fathers day comin up  spend some time  make the call  golf or tennis or somethin  mans sacrificed his dreams to change your smelly ass diapers fr
tryna get her to come over and clean fr 
seggs later probably 
One of my pet peeves is when super beautiful girls don't respond to my text messages immediately
If I like a horrifyingly offbase tweet I was probably just scrolling thru liking ok  you don't have to panic your tits
Might pick up some more RUNE if it reaches dat deterministic prussy
Anyways back to Cleaning Hiatus
I tried putting my earphones in and listening to Saturnine by Dan Abnett but it was the scene where Rogal Dorn and Kyril Sindermann were standing in the rain on the ramparts discussing the nature of fear and it was so enrapturing good I had to stop cleaning and enjoy it
I am literally sitting here not cleaning
When a chick has anarchist in her bio issa red flag  how you tryna start a life together when there's no rules, centralization or order  I need a nice traditional conversative lady that doesn't fit in with most traditional conservatives and I need her yesterday
I truly think most of you reading this can make it but you have to be patient  and you already know that  but you want to be rich TODAY 
She gets it  This is alpha  Even if your bankroll is 4 figs  You need to envision how it would feel if it was 8 figs, then only take trades that an 8 fig trader would take, as those will be the best setups, gleaned from a place of abundance  or you could keep degen'ing 
The Portuguese Civ Theme is Age of Empires 2 DE is perfect  so absolutely perfect  
I mean wait until we get the wick that liqs celsius' long and then bid whatever right  that's pretty much the move now right  like ik it sucks but that's just the way it is I think
this does really help but I've slacked on it lately 
I don't know why I hate cleaning so much  Is it just because it requires absolutely no mental challenge  it's just busy work  idk because there's plenty of busy work I really don't mind  anyone found out how to psyops yourself into enjoying it?
I'm telling you it's a dangerous game for Celsius to keep adding collateral  I think the fuckening is programmed
I dont lol  idk if I ever said this on a tweet on my page but   for anyone that doesn't know, the reason I moved to the midwest was to take care of my dad who got cancer during the pandemic  he's better now so I'm going back 
BuT ChE It'S EaSy FoR U To SaY YoU AlReDy HeV MuNeY  yeah and I got it all without compromising my ethics  so dont come at me with that moral flexibility bullshit 
I strongly believe that money is everything is one of the most midwit, npc takes there is
I rly dont judge people who shill good stuff they themselves blv in, or put ref links or make nfts or whatever  but if I hear someone turned down blatant scams and spared their audience that bs I'm impressed  their integrity might be 'measured' in the millions they didn't accept 
Y'all should cultivate trust too imo  I'd be richerin $ if I sold out,   I calc'd it and if I accepted the paid shill p&amp;d scams and rolled em into my stack on the way up and sold when I did...  I woulda make an extra 5-10 mil ish last cycle  not everything is about money tho 
I've been thinking a lot about the Attention Economy  I used to think hmm I'd better secure my place in the Attention Economy so I can make money easily do some kind of business or advertise myself in some way  but I actually think just having attention itself IS a currency
my biggest error was to win the first few rounds of Catan with @Brentsketit , @BryptoBelz and @JandX_   afterwhich they all made sure I never won again 
I get so many dms from Tradingview trying to foist a free pro account upon me because I'm an influenza  Desist, ye scallywags  I shall not be placed above my people  but rather shall walk amongst my people  my poor, tradingview pro-less plebs that I love so much
However, I must compliment her on the food she cooks or she gets sad that I don't  it is a delicate arte 
I can never say oh that looks tasty about a food my mom has in her kitchen or she will never let me leave until I take it with me
At what point to we stop rooting for Celsius not to get liquidated and start begging them not to add more collateral so their liq price keeps going lower
I literally just burn down every place I live before moving and buy new stuff with the insurance  I hitchhike to avoid paying gas money  I just make them think I might be a criminal and they dont ask me to pay  I arrive in a new city with a laptop and air mattress ready to go
if the housing market implodes I will buy a house in Austin  who wants to come over for Catan on weekends?
Hello valued, honored, esteemed rent-meat. Please be advised that a potential tenant will be seeing your apartment tomorrow.  broh I am TIRED of cleaning my PLACE
If I’m honest  my entire existence be like:  Im here to original-meme and expel ball juice  and Im fresh out of original memes 
indeed  a man could be out in the northern reaches of Siberia  alone, freezing  and if he finds food, shelther… basic warmth  he will still find something to hump next 
Every year I feel the horny get stronger and my decisions having to do with said horny get stupider  I suppose this is why the human species has continued so long

Maren could get away with actually being a real life witch right under our nose hiding in plain sight and none of you mfs would blv it because she's being performative enough to pull off it being an act rather than real 
As someone with a 'prestigious' graduate degree I can tell you I have never used it except to wipe my own ass 
I stg if a chick brings up she went to Harvard on a first date I will next I dont care if everything else is perfect ijdc  if you went to Harvard you are sus to me with limited exceptions  because you have to be the kind of person that would choose to go there 
I think the worst thing is the types that bring it up  on dates  casually when hanging out  I know like 6 dudes I worked with from ivy's that were aight and they never brought that shit up - they were there pragmatically  the rest should go huff their degrees fr 
Is anyone impressed by pedigree anymore?  Seems to me ivy league and UChicagoey types get more pretentious and less skilled every single year  and I never thought much of most of them to begin with  and yes before u say wont bc cant I got accepted to ivy schools and didn't go
all the retards that pay 1 btc a month for their paid group leader to lead them to poverty were all shitting on Maren's astrology but we'll probably see it perfectly nail the bottom literally months in advance keke
yall ever wonder if I have a favorite alt
I’ll be running that Walmart inside of a week 
If trading gurus have taught me anything  it's that the reason any trade goes badly is because you just weren't cold and emotionless enough
I deadass dreamed I started up working at a Walmart last night 
I'm watching Survivorman  he's like  I'm absolutely starving  and there's literally NO food out here  except these extremely cute turtles  *turtles crawl all over him and call him da da*  nasty business eating a turtle you have to mutilate it for half an hour before it gives in
litty 
if u aint make a zoomer alt to stay wid the times  you might lose out on certain veins of the attention economy  💀 
I'm finna lern this zoomer lingo so good y'all aint ever gon' suspect I'm cappin
great thing about being 31 on this app is you can lie that you're 18 and say no 🧢  even when u deadass cappin' fr

I say we just liquidate everything that needs to get liquidated all at once in a mighty, sweeping purge  celisus, usdd etc  whatever  send everything way low  into my bids  then it can go up again
Spokesman for Celsius be like:  Look dawgs there's no great way to say this but I took all the money we had deposited and I put in on 22 black  so it's entirely gone now  it was in the contract  I'd say I'm sorry but I'm not  I'm glad it happened 
all ur money gone and for what 8% on stables? 
on g I haven't been following the celsius thing closely bc ijdc  but is it the thing I figured would happen months ago where they gambled everyone's assets on mex and got liq'd?
You're a stain on my legacy We can't be friends, can't be family (Oh) You probably fuck all my enemies (Oh) I can't let you be next to me Oh, you belong to the world now So just leave me alone now We're not in touch no more

if friend is gettin fat af, most of the time positive wording will do more than teasing  ie - hey you look like u been workin out broh  but that does zilch for me lol  way better if someone says che u pussy ur getting fat as fuck dawg wtf  I'll be like YOU KNO WAT  U RIGHT. 
It's easy to forget how many mfs grow by praise instead of teasing insults lol  probably easily 75%+  not me though I grow by someone telling me I can't do something  easy to forget others aint like us eh

There is no greater level of orgasmic pleasure than telling your teammate he looks fine when he's getting absolutely destroyed instead of helping
cheeee come helpppp I'm getting teammmmed  broh SHHH I'm tryna 6 tc boom over here you look fine 
I prefer 1v1s  because in a 2v2 the reason we lose if we do is always my teammate  and the reason we win is because I carried  just the way it is  teammates always lazy slouches fr
what I mean by that is that I dont think I'm charismatic or special  I think I'm genuine and I tweeted alot lol  people are equipped to love what is genuine in others so if you just tweet a shitload and have a good attitude towards others, eventually you'll spin up a following 
On fooo I literally just tweets ANYTHING that ran across my mind lol  star trek takes  dating stories that weren't doxable to anyone  funny insights  shower thoughts  whenever I had some thought, esp crypto related, I'd just tweet that shit, no editing, no revising  60k tweets 
I think the way I built up my main account on twitter was the same way I made my bankroll in crypto  I'm not one of the exceptions  one of these survivorship bias, farmed the right thing, bought at the right time guys  I'm an average joe that took safe set ups and was patient
you also have to tweet from your main alot  and get over your insecurity  JKT  just keep tweeting  soon all veils of pretense will melt away and you will literally share your stream of consciousness  the more genuine and unfiltered, the better 
You want to know how to gain and maintain a following? Even if you may not have a ton of swag?  Be positive. Not cloyingly cheerful, but just good vibes.  Uplift others. Spread joy. Be wholesome. Don't except transaction, immediate benefits from it. Do it because you want to.  yw
I think the true bottom of this bear market is going to be the scariest one so far  because we actually do have a looming threat of macro recession  crypto never been thru one of those
I must be massively autistic because I actually except my future waifu to be an asset not a liability  my male friends: urgh no you're not in alignment with my social conditioning where I have to suffer the drain of my finances and life force to maintain a relationship

we gonna have a round of dip buyers get in 90% down and they will lose the same 90% of their investment the guy that sold it to them who was down 90% was down even tho the cone goes down from 10 to 1 instead of 100 to 10  I really do think we bounce at some point doe 
daily remindizzle  if yo shitcone that u love so much went down 90%  it can go down 90% again and be down 99%!  and again and be down 99.9%!  aha
The problem with actually not caring about money that much and saying it and it being true  is u have plenty of guys that only say it when theyve lost it all  and that confirms the stereotype of the whole “only wont bc cant” notion 
I never hated bayc   I thought the seed phrase memes were funny  but man some of those mfs that wrote threads like “Why I am in touch and a genius and you arent and why you are DEEP in your feelings about it”   they about to have they first dose of the other side of crypto

The Quaresma Conference is probably going to be the hottest networking event of the next few years  I heard Drake is gonna be giving a talk about NFTs there like an hour before I talk about DN  Rumors are they called it “Quaresma” bc thats the title of his next album but idk

Anyone scooping up DN rn?
The 200 weekly memeing average is at 23kekes  so I mean I guess I could be buying in no man's land now  and we go and bounce off the memeing average  everyone thinks bear market over  then we fall thru later and feb 2023 is true bottom below the 200 weekly

As soon as you tweet seriously on Twitter it’s over for u  I dont make the rules
For all y’all asking how you can get your hands on DN  DN cant be bought yet  you have to request DN to be airdropped  for more info DM me “Can you let me get my hands on DN airdrop” or “airdrop DN into my strong hands”
3 in a row! 
got em  twice in a row! 
Every single DeFi project be like  ay we making this thing and if it doesnt work the whole market will crash but itll work trust me broh
Finally 
Who y'all got 
The pick 2 to defend you the rest will attack you memes I've seen are a little imba  I'm going to spend my Friday evening devising a more balanced one for you guys
I'm gonna have komodos and hornets left over dude ez 
Yeah I have to stick with my Komodos/Hornets final answer  Komodos can slorp up dem spiderinos and then work on bringing down the big boys  Hornets get some stings in (and toast the buzzards ez too)  I'll handle the elephant myself
ahhh interesting it looks like Honey Badgers might be a hard counter the komodos, hornets and spiders  hmmm 
if I could spook the enemy elephant into running amok, it might just squash some of my other enemies for some nice friendly fire 
I'm seeing alot of elephant/hornet combo  I think that's also a reasonable choice - elephant skin is thicc af and nigh on impenetrable  but the chief concern is that the elephant would scare and run amok and you'd fall off  I'd actually be comfy dealing with an enemy elephant 
Komodos by far the best pick here  sharp claws, venomous, paralytic bite, fast moving, stealthy, stone cold killas and there's a full dozen  I would have been happy with 4!  after it was clarified that the wasps are murder hornets those mfs are absolutely huge  Komodos/Hornets fs 
I guess if those are murder hornets not wasps that poses a true threat  300 is tons  they are fast as fuck there's no way I evade 300 hornets no matter how hangry my badgers are  I might have to go hornets/komodos  and me and the komodos will go stealth while hornets attack first 
y'all sleeping on Komodos brohs  they're 7 feet long, angry, stealthy, cold mfs  sharp teeth and claws  I think 2 komodos could take a tiger and 3 a polar bear gg ez no re  my komodos and honey badgers dealing with everything except the elephant  which I will deal with myself 
Yeah ok those aren't hawks they're buzzards  I wouldn't go for the buzzards, buzzards would eat shit in this battle  But yeah I think the honey badgers and the komodo dragons, hbs take out the insects and tank, kds are big mfs and they have sharp claws  I'm going for raw numbers 
With the last one I felt really confident in my eagles and rats choice  this one was harder I think  I think I'd take the 25 honey badgers to tank dps, sponge poison and wasp stings and eat the bugs  those mfs ferocious too  and then I guess? the hawks and tell em go for the eyes 
Even when I have a family and kids  I'll probably do a long 3 day weekend once a month, even if I have to lock myself in my study or go to a hotel and game on a laptop  super important for my healthy mental state lol  Idk how some of y'all live without ever being alone 
y'all ever tell your friends and family you're going on a business trip for a week and then just shut yourself into your place with a 12 pack of energy drinks and game for a week and be alone from everyone to recharge?  I do  I need a week every couple months of pure aloneness
They're doing a presentation on DN seed round at the upcoming Quaresma Conference  u guys going to that? if you're confused feel free to DM me asking Quaresma what? 
I have diamond hands when it comes to DN I’m never letting go 
lotta ppl scrambling to asking me how to get their hands on DN these days  happy to explain in the DM  just ask me “Hey Che, how can I get my hands on DN?” 
I personally have a heavy bag of DN 
y'all look into DN yet btw?  great new project  not a paid shill I just like them alot  good team of 2 
My indifference to the current thing wafts off of me like a pleasing odor  others bask in my joy and say damn, why is this guy so good vibes. What is his secret sauce  Everywhere I go, people are relaxed and comfortable in my presence  they say that man  is an indifferent man
I literally only deeply care about like 12 things  and the current thing?  definitely not one of them
Test levels and indifference to the current thing are positively correlated  Stress levels, inversely correlated  hourly reminder
Daily reminder that I dont care about the current thing  I literally just lifted heavy and then grilled a grassfed ribeye and dipped each bite into organic first cold pressed extracted unfiltered extra virgin italian olive oil with some pink salt  Now I'm going on a walk
At this point there’s no excuse to complain about literally anything in life if u aint doin these first 
Imagine not agreeing with all my opinions  ngmi

The secret to happiness is literally just to inhale high quality olive oil and grassfed steak and and lift heavy and suntan ones nuts  I dont make the rules
I swear you click one wrong button and the iphone prompts you with “so you want to share your recently viewed porn sites with your contacts?”

the problem with that is that by CT standards I'm probably average or below  even with a moderately athletic physique  I'm pretty sure every single anon on CT is shredded and yolked af and 9% bodyfat with a perfect v taper  so I'd still have to rely on my goblin jokes mainly

I should be one of the contestants on the next Bachelorette  I've always wanted to see how that show works from the inside  I wouldn't want to win though, if I didn't get insta-elimed I'd leave 3-4 eps in probably
Alot of people tell me they feel surprisingly safe holding DN right now
I kind of prefer the timeline now  I secretly find the overly bullish retardation tiresome  it's nice to see dogshit projects get humbled as well  I remember hearing Cobie say he was much more easily able to see why something couldn't work than why it could  I'm that way as well
I'm pretty sure I will never meet much less have sex with any of the egirls that simp for my main  I just flirt because I enjoy it  but maybe tho idk 
My little brother is a DJ as a side gig and works in marketing as his main occupation  it's awesome to watch the synergy  He's creative af  so proud  I vent my excess pride here though  Don't want him thinking I'm getting all sentimental now
I get alot of DMs asking if I am also Gainzy  I am not Gainzy, but I can understand why you all might think I was  or am I
As well,  here is some alpha on how to grow your following:  1. Tweet more on your main page 2. Be a replyguy to someone you like or look up to so it's organic, not forced for attention 3. Spread good vibes 4. Share alpha on whatever you know about 5. Don't view it transactionaly 
I've been on Twitter since like 2019  How to Win Twitter:  1. This platform must serve YOU not the reverse 2. Mute/Block early and often, ppl are not entitled to your attention or your feed 3. Mute conversations early and often 4. Focus mostly on tweeting not reacting 
the governement WANTS u to only be happy if you ignore it  be miserable as u fight about what it's doing on social media with others that have differing opinions about what it's doing and be miserable  and don't bother getting enough money to actually change things at all! 
Noooooo you can't just be happy, do the things you enjoy, take care of yourself and loved ones first and then those around youuuu  you need to argue with me about UBI nooooooo 
If a conversation I'm tagged in begins to fail my personal vibe check, I simply mute it and proceed with not giving a fuck and putting out joyous, wholesome vibes of my own  this is ancient happy guy tradition
I am amazed that women don't just flatter my ego more  I love it when they call me Big Poppa  that's literally all that's required 
Acceptable questions include  What and how do I get to Quaresma?  or   Can I also hodl DN? 
Anyone that wants to learn more about how they could hold DN or to learn about the Quaresma Conference coming up can DM me
Yo @IAMLLUCIANA was telling me about the Quaresma Financial Conference coming up  I heard there's gonna be an entire exposé about DN there
I am massively bullish on DN  despite the wider macro environment
y'all can start out by just nibbling DN  you don't have to hold it all at once 
I'm gonna hodl DN through this whole bear market  comfy hodl'ing DN at least  and cash
I feel like most of you ain't even heard of DN  much less could handle DN
tryna get the word out about DN these days  feels like I'm carrying around a heavy weight fr
Y’all sleepin on DN fr
almost to 15kekes  haha  on g  Reminds me of DN 
if you were a real man you'd afford to buy our family a nicer CAR mouths the milf to her provider slave as she exits the Buick and walks past me into the gas station as I leave with a baggie full of Xyience  she gives me the fuck me eyes as I get into my ancient corolla
it's true  much unlike the stereotype  INTJs are actually cool and chill and are often found in their ray bans at gas stations  while ISTJs are on quora and Personality Database arguing about why they are INTJs not ISTJs 
about to walk to the gas station and pick up some energy drinks  I'm going to wear my ray bans  with my ray bans on, I have the swag of a minor deity, or perhaps a powerful demigod
To many of you this sounds like paradise compared to your current situation  which is why it will all be voted in

No one in the entire world would play a Haytham Kenway from Assassin's Creed III better than I would  if they make a film adaptation of that game I am going to land that role  I must
I live my life based on deontological principles  if I reach 10 figs I will still cut a shitcoin loss on a backwater exchange for $400 and send it back to coinbase  it's the principle of that thing  the odds don't matter, the consequences are secondary  serves my life well 
I think one of the wrongest things I often see in the world is the theory that people wont because they can't  you won't foot the bill or check bc u cant  u won't fly first class bc u can't  etc  It baffles me that more mfs dont try to conceal their power level
Ai God celebrating his 10 million dollar bet victory with a bowl of rice and apple sauce was a top ten CT Sigma moment
I think hedge funds are mostly just fancy paid groups  why would I trade someone else's money when I can just successfully trade mine  you run a paid group because you can't trade well without a paid group or you're too impatient to spin up your own bankroll change my mind
99.999% of discussion about finance topics boils down to guys with ivy mbas doing this 
I think 99% of the talk in the finance space  is mfs trying to justify to themselves why some other mf gave them a bunch of their money  and justify to themselves that they are important and a hardworker  by finding shit to yammer on about all day  99.999% is utterly meaningless 
I swear man CT is like a pen full of clucking hens  today they're clucking about decorrelation  feathers are ruffling as they eye one another nervously  stop trying to ascribe meaning where there is none
it'd be stressful AF to manage other peoples' money too  I build my life around having literally zero stress at all times while maximizing my ability to do whatever I want and answer to no one 
It blows my mind to think how many offers I have from wealthy folks in the DMs trying to get me to manage their money for 2 and 20 (or more)  I decline not because it's not an insanely comfy offer  I decline  because I'm lazy AF and I ijdc
my relationships never last because I never pay the girl enough attention  when she realizes that me being immersed in the 100% autism-bliss of turbo-focus on something 99% of the time isn't an act, nor something she can change, her faces does what I call the droop

My favorite response is “I dont love it  but I dont hate it”
Win a game be like  Ez + wasnt trying + fcked ur mom + ur literally my son
a great one if they are making excuses or getting angry is  “Seethe.” 
honorable mentions  “ez no re”  “wasnt trying”  “gf was suckin me off same time” 
There is no better feeling on Earth than simply saying “ez” in the chat after a tremendously hardfought win instead of “gg”  and I’m tired of pretending there is

I will make it hurt so bad in those four words  I will take my time with it  the perfect torture is an exquisite symphony of agony, played for an audience of one 
Pretty sure Irene isnt managing that account so I wont  but if you are out there and you ask for the hurting in the 4 words  and it’s you  I cannot promise I will be able to restrain myself from the open invitation   Lord forgive me 
idk dude this “hurt me in 4 words” trend is tempting the darkest side of me to come out and play 
Ive also noticed that as a kid, I was much more willing to play extremes  extreme greed  extreme cheeee  all in rush  turtled, micro intensive defense boom  nowadays my play is more balanced  it would be rly interesting to vs my 16 y/o self 
I play real time strategy games at high level  and an interesting thing about getting older  is Ive noticed my brain change how it processes situations  when I was 16, I was ultra creative and improvisational  at 31, Im experienced but set in my ways  brain feels less creative 
the virgin “crypto bro” disparagooor   vs  the chad crypto bro enjoyooor 
If I see an article title using the moniker “crypto bros” disparagingly  I immediately know the author has hate in his or her heart  ultimately due to their own insecurities  imagine living with hate in your heart  sad!  gm

The only crime I would ever be indicted for if my dms were leaked  is having no game
I have 8 active dm convos goin rn  not urs tho
gn brohs  tomorrow etc
I really think that almost without exception  P.T. Barnum was way ahead of his time when he said there’s no such thing as bad press  Esp on a platform like twitter  the opposite of love is indifference, not hate  esp here
CT is the best  I know it can get really whacked out when there’s blood in the streets  but that’s part of its charm
Early Uniswap days were the funnest days in crypto of all time  I remember tossing 1 eth into some random shit and just watching the eth multiply before my eyes in hours
I still remember hitting a cool 50x on Retard Token in 40 minutes and selling the top and posting those soulja boy gifs
I miss the hyper redardation days on early uniswap in 2020 where mfs were like  It's 'GO UP COIN' the coin meant to go up!  and it went up like 400x in the first hour then rugged  then they made like  creamy xampl go up coin tendies spin offs that just immediately rugged
broh we don't need crypto indexes  just buy the good ones and avoid the bad ones
I just texted I am horny, my darling to my ex  this was a good idea  I think a great idea actually
Jesus  if I wanted exposure to polygon and fucken filecoin I'd just be a dumbass  I dont need to buy an index for that 
I haven't had a meme I've enjoyed as much as this one in many moons 
any female wants to see me noods for me to evaluate I mean  I would.......  no pressure only if you want to haha  know what I mean? 
I'm already imagining our life together 
I actually found a tinder match that is kind of cute and not absolute SHIT at witty bants
market be like   Oh I'll go up  I'm just going to make you experience a ton of horrible pain first  completely unneccessarily
It's Midnight  and I am hungry  and I  am  horny
public school was a nonstop orgy between students and teachers  teaches would come to algebra class in a tight lil mini skirt and a tied off tee  if bobby is cumming from one angle, and timmy is cumming from another angle, how fast until maria's face is covered in nut sauce 
I dont trust any mf that doesnt follow fooo

I eat clean asf 6 days a week  on the seventh I consume only corn syrup and seed oil idc
“che what if the reason you cant find the right ride or die shorty is because you split the check on a first date”  Im pretty sure it’s actually bc Im massively autistic tbh
Im getting doordash from across the street and the mf is dropping another order off first   fuck me why was I a lazy bastard
fooo is a maverick my dude  he’s unpredictable   I cant control him  he doesnt answer my dms

I like to blast this one when I'm doing pull ups or dips outside when people are watching  
I'm going to imagine I'm the minotaur hunting down my people food in the Minoan Labyrinth while I bench press and listen to this  
old fling: I met this new guy and he makes me so happy, but he's sick and I'm so scared for him.  me: is he bigger than me? 
Alright lads  It is simply time for me to lift heavy wheels of iron, securely fastened onto a bar of iron, up off of the ground until my moskles are too drained of energy to continue and then chug down hydrolyzed prohtons so I can get BIGGER
lmao some journo actually calls out will u run for president at the end  He is a fucking good orator  imagine if someone like him with a soul was in politics how easily they would win 
Our future president  Rust Cohle 
CT when we get a 1% relief rally after 6 months of straight down 
I am convinced that nothing will break our CT spirit  we can go down 99% over and over and over and over until our portfolios are all 1 cent  and we will still sperg with autistic eudaimonia every single 1% relief rally  and that is why I have boundless love for CT
forecast for tomorrow?  Saudi with a chance of rain 
Did u paperhand all your coins to the sheikhs anon?
Rune up 10% on the news that FTX will delist it
This is my account where I follow friends  not like that elitist FOOO  so if we're friends and I'm not following you yet it's an accident  *mutes thread bc I know everyone is going to swarm me on this at once and this is just an FYI, over time it will be fixed*
The sheikhs are among us brothers 
The woke mob will never cancel meat because this is true  at least until we have mass produced warbots  because it takes men to enforce mandates on men  sorry Soyjack NOT TODAY

I will never eat the locust bars  I will never live in the pods  I will not accept the microchips  I will not go vegan, but rather consume meat  I will continue to hunt  I will confront teachers that brainwash my kids  I will avoid politics and the news  I will sunbathe my sack
This is what I imagine every single conversation at nft conferences is like 
ahhhh fuckkk dawggggg bust out them figs  Oh you wanna see deez figs?  I do man, nice mutant ape btw, what's its rarity score  It's the 69th rarest....  uurmmmmmmm fuggggg dude, I'm half mast already 
Everytime some guy on CT that I don't recognize tweets Just had a threesome, especially if he has a rare nft pfp, I become instantly 100% certain it was a 3some with 2 other men
In this brave new world in whichst we livest  only the most beautiful, voluptuous women  and the most turbo autistic men   will reproduce
Doing X thing I don't politically agree with??  IN THIS ECONOMY??
Eat the locust bars. Live in the pods. Accept the brain chips. Accept the ID chips. Accept the payment chips. Vote in the election. Support the current thing. Eat Corn Syrups. Eat Seed Oils. Reproduce like Hogs. Keep quiet around the Teachers that brainwash ur kids. 
I just need to find my Lana out there 
Will the massive head and shoulders meme play out where all the redards actually try to front run it while jerking it to investopedia  I fucking doubt that shit  run it back turbo 3k eth by frogust
Lemmy is an up and comer  Lemmy is a Lemur with potential  We like the Lemmy 
I just saw one of the most redarded takes on the timeline  but I let the urge to start beef pass over and through me  not out of forgiveness  but because it doesnt need more attention

Im already tired of reading takes about it too  luckily Mo’s law will quickly get rid of it for us  soon we’ll have something new we’re getting tired of reading about 
I’m pretty sure at least 3 of my dm conversations with “hot women” that are secrrtly run by dudes as a joke now feel they are in too deep and must maintain the charade
I always get woken up during a sex dream right when it getting good  even in my dreams I cant score fr
My mind is going a mile a minute  but tomorrow Ill be tired all day until it’s time to sleep when my mind will awaken like a great beast
It is 3:20 am  I am hungry and I am horny

Che, do you want me to bring my laptop over and we can play a LAN playthrough of Baldur's Gate 1&amp;2 just our two characters and see if we can beat it without taking any npcs into the party, and if we die, it's perma and we have to start over?  yes, imaginary soulmate  I do

omg mfs are already dm'ing me asking if I'll shill their stuff  you guys wont blv it but I think I have probably turned down at least several million dollars in shill offers  I dont say this to try and sound holier than thou  I say this because I actually am holier
I like to kick things off with  henlo 
I get hella matches 
ok Sadie actually seems like kind of a sweetheart ngl 
Tinder Profiles of the Midwest Continued 
Tinder is where all the slithering demi-humans come to mate  a murky, rotting bog  a quagmire where horror-zombies rub their uglies in the wretched dark  this is where the sub 100 iqs come to play  this is where they meet  like a pen for ruminants
Should I make more Tinder Profiles of the Midwest memes this evening or should I just watch a movie and go to bed
my best friend in college had an older sister that looked just like this btw  sometimes she'd sit next to me in lectures and laugh at my jokes  I almost nutted 
No one is perfect  But yes I can't stand fake nails they look awful and goofy af  natural nails look 100x better no exceptions  but I'm not made of stone, let her have her indulgences 
Do you feel like the Hellenic City-State system or the Sartrapy system of the Medes and later Persian Empire was the superior form for organizing a Bronze age state, and in particular the landed elite bae  - My imaginary soulmate that doesn't exist 
What if we just get a camping tent and some MREs and go out in the wilderness with woad body paint and  take shrooms this week babe  - My soul mate that doesn't exist 
I'm extremely progressive on lgbt insomuch as I don't care what someone's sexual orientation is  I only care how they are as a person  whether they have integrity, are fun to be around etc  their character  I have a moderately strong take on pronouns when it veers into narcissism 
I think it's hard for some people to understand how hard it is to resist cyberbullying  it makes me feel so good when I do it  to resist it is not easy lol
Needless to say I've blocked alot this month kek 
If I see a dumb take and I start wanting to cyber bully I just block the mf on the second offense in the same week and move on  I'm an adult I have to lead by example
I take shit from nobody  death first 
I aced a grad level feminism course  top marks in the whole class  Im conversant in feminist theory  I occassionally have to mansplain feminism to a young entitled thot on a date that doesnt know shit about feminism except that she is a woman and has embraced entitlement about it 
None of you guys know who she is  She's probably the best female age of empires 2 player  and hot  and she streams 
I would do Lavie Head the age 2 streamer up in the bed like a MONSTER
hey Che do you wanna go over tapes of your high level 1v1's on Ranked Ladder to see where there were small errors or inefficiencies that cost you games you could have won?  Yes, imaginary soulmate  yes I do 
If your pronouns are shchmee schmeey schmaa I think you probably just need to get over your fucken self and get a damn life tbh
I say 25% because it is a measured and precise reaction  I know there are plenty of dudes that are just trying to get by and they live in some city or work at some institution where they're de facto forced to put their pronouns in bios  they just want to be left in peace 
if you got he/him in your bio I am 25% less likely to invite you to hang out  because I find you are probably 25% more likely to say hey not cool man about a joke I make, when it was, in fact, cool 
Put your pronouns in your bio if you must but I will look at you with a little more wariness  and you can guarantee I will never put my pronouns in my bio  death first
I guarantee I am better than Elon Musk at any RTS game 
broh he literally just sat on Jaylen Brown  literally just laid his feet on his head, then shoved him, then pulled his pants down, who even knows what he was saying  pussy ass refs didn't call anything because it was in GS and they scared to make waves 
I cant blv they didnt eject Draymond btw he must be stopped he'll keep doing it he just dc
Celtics were like man we already came in here and took a nice steaming dump on these Warriors in game 1 lets just fuck around for game 2 and regroup in boston ijdc
Stuff like this is interesting  It's definitely a virtue signal in a way  but I think they believe in it as well and it's not doing any harm...  It's also extremely unspecific  but it's a vibe they're going for  I don't hate it, it's probably a slight net positive 
Wholesome artsy or nerdy girls with good values &gt;&gt;&gt; all  That's partially just about who I am as well though  It's funny dude I could have just as easily been happy living on 30k-40k a year  I just happen to really like games of strategy and financial markets 
Daily reminder that I find a woman that makes 30k and lives happily on 25k a year infinitely more appealing  than a woman that makes 500k a year but spends it all and is in debt  maybe my preference is irrelevant to nearly everything but I still like blasting it out there
I tend to agree, especially in Musks case  Guy built some companies  Went about pushing for green energy and space exploration.  didn't ask permission, just went about doing it  while lazy hipsters hate on him drinking their free trade coffee while being subsidized by welfare 
But it was green 
Being blanket jaded is just as myopic as being blanket naive  each individual ought to be evaluated seperately 
I know it's popular to be loudly jaded about the motives of the untouchably rich  but with Musk I think he's got right intention, more or less, in a big picture sense  I almost think that people who are just loudly, always jaded are in a way naive 
I know everyone loves to hate on Elon  and I'll step on many, many toes when I say  I think he actually genuinely wants the best for humanity, and I think most of his actions are aligned with that mission  he may or may not be correct  but I believe he actually wants what's best
Pengturabo one of the pillars of wholesomeness on CT 
Someday my main is going to breach whatever threshold where I finally start getting scam bots showing up under every reply   DM me.  hmu  I think that's probably a bigger flex on the haters than a reply could ever be  blah blah you suck man!  3 bots reply to him dm me.
Hey babe, she calls out from the living room, Deep Space 9 is on Netflix, should we just order in and binge Season 5 and 6  I would get so fucken horny 
all I need is a shorty that likes being frugal and making spreadsheets and has her own hobbies about which I know comparatively less like rocketry or aeronautical engineering but we both like sci fi and she supports my sci fi writing attempts  is that so much to even ask for 
JESUS  where all the hourglass honeys hiding at 
I will say obscure family guy quotes as a response to a question and if you don't get it, that's on you
idk bros  lotta peeps saying when the time is right, she'll find you  I don't really get romantics that blv in serendipity and stuff  I think my odds are best if I audition 1 a night
Not interested in having any more kids either hur hur  do the manly thing and take care of my kids only hur hur 
Me and my son when I have a son someday 
This is Katya Elise Henry's only shot to get with me  I'm a massive upgrade from Tyler Herro tbh  but she's playing hard to get smh
Help my campaign to seduce Katya Elise Henry brohs I feel like it's going well 
Look at the thinly-veiled hatred (of self and of the provider) in their eyes  little seperates them from grazing ruminants except that hate  what even lies beneath it  scared of the stygian, too-far-gone pits they might find... better to not look  thankkkkkk uuuuuuuuuuuu 😘😘😘 
I was out this mf market when everyone told me rate hikes weren't going to matter  I bought back in a little bit once everyone told me rate hikes are our clear and present danger  and you best believe once I see cockiness on the TL again  I'll be back mostly out
Nothing like mfs I probably have way more money than but would never bother showing off because Idgaf trying to flex on me with symbols of material status
It's time for some green in the markets dudes  it just is  idc  give us some green ijdc
I'm sorry but Coinbase freeing up my withdrawals 10 minutes after I started tweeting about it isn't a coincidence   can't be
I literally swipe left on these women  and if one of them impressed me with a happenstance meeting in person, we're going dutch first date  because I have means, I'd eventually be okay with paying if she doesn't have means  but social norms are dumb to me and mean nothing to me 
LOL withdrawals just freed up within 10 minutes of me posting this  they are watching reee 
I mean  think about what being based means  it means you don't care what others think and youre genuine and do what you care about and go after what you like/want  if you're caught up in the materialism rat race, you can't be based by definition  just different levels of cringe 
I'm not hostile to this way of thinking per se  As a sigma, however, I do perceive it as kind of pitiable  No matter how much you try to dominate the materialism sandbox, you'll always be playing by someone else's rules and unlocking acheivements in someone else's game 
No one pushes Gobly into a corner
Imagine if I started a massive meme campaign that was intensely mocking and critical of Coinbase  In what universe would it be worth it for them to freeze a few withdrawals if that's the alternative 
It'll go better for Coinbase if they see this and just stop freezing peoples' withdrawals  You don't understand how many accounts I have on Crypto Twitter  you don't want this smoke  I wage wars of attrition  I get results
Good question  Probably 3 in fast succession 
If I didn't have a conscience I would make a yelp account and only leave 1 star reviews that were intentionally stupid as hell  urnnn great food und gud survice at dis restrunt but I dint like the colur uf the sign outsed. 1 ster
Yes Experian I know my credit score is 840 you don't have to keep sucking my dick all damn day leave some room for other spam email
I vow  that if Coinbae doesn't let me withdraw within another 24 hours from now  they won't be bae anymore  They won't be Coinbased  they'll be CoinCringe
I'm so protective and miserly of even spending money  imagine how viciously protective I'll be of my kids someday
BRUH  I keep trying to go to coinbase support and write to a human about why they won't let me withdraw anymore  and it keeps logging me out LOL  wtaf is going on here
Someday 
Hi this is Coinbase Support!  We noticed that you've been sending alot of USD and BTC out of our platform recently  and we decided to forbid you from doing it anymore  because it's suspicious!!!  for more questions, re-contact me here at support :D
I'm going from humurously amused but a little annoying with Coinbase for delaying my withdrawals for my protection to progressively more angry
I saw a man at the gas station with his young daughter in a little sundress  she was giggling and begging him for a slice of pizza  whole thing was massively wholesome and joy inducing  I think I'm getting the male version of baby crazy  which I guess is just baby crazy
He is gonna be just insufferable when hes right 
I gotta cure this ASMR tingle immunity  who is the best ASMR channel for tingles
100 likes and I jerk it
The only right answer on this app is  care less
I'm pretty sure I dont have to check on skip bayless' twitter page to know what he's tweeting about  he's gushing about KD isn't he  we all know he is  why even look
Tinder Profiles of the Midwest continued 
Tinder Profiles in the Midwest continued 
dating app profiles be like  betcha can't beat me at air hockeyyy :P  I bet you I fucking can  It would be easy for me  within 3 points I'll have figured you out completely  from there it will be pure, one-sided dominance  I am extremely confident that I will win at air hockey
Katya Elise Henry bout to upgrade from Tyler Ohno  to Che Guevoyeah
imagine if this ratio's her initial tweet lmfao 
lmao sometimes I create alts I dont even remember 
help me get this some likes so she sees it brohs  I'm shooting my shot fr 
ah her dms are closed  damn  I'll have to shoot my shot out in the open  lucky I'm a better shooter than Herro  they call me Tlaloc the Rain God from beyond the arc 
Tyler Herro's waifu from an angle of which I, personally, am rather fond  he just cheated on her and she's probably feeling alone and vulnerable  in this situation I have to ask myself  How could I, in good conscience, not slide into those DMs 
I will eat mayo out the jar idc
I'm pretty sure mayo increases testosterone via a direct action on the testis 
Mayo goes on everything
Probably because just like with any other good thing  it starts out as for the passion by the passion  and then gets monetized to death by uncreative hacks who only care about being able to keep up with their alimony payments this month 
Been playing Super Mario 64 that shit is fun as fuck  30 year old game better than any of the crap they're coming out with nowadays
Doordashers be like  ay man your fries were DELICIOUS
This is literally every single Midwestern Tinder account I run into 
bUt wHaT iF sHe HaS a GoOd PeRsoNaliTy  I know she doesn't already   you want to know how I know?  bc she catfished 
No mercy for catfishers  if she looks nothing like the advertising I just leave  I know she'll somehow make *me* the asshole  but she's the asshole 
I got catfished on a date this evening  I was like  OHH GODDDD OH NO  NO NO NO  YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE YOUR PHOTOS  *PUKESSSSS*   OH IM  IM GONNA BE SICK  UGHHHHHHH
yyyyeahhhhhhhhhhoowwwwwwww!!!!!! 
LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLL  FOUND IT!  
you guys remember that video where the guy was like   whoaaaaahhh it went to zerooooo  AHHHHWOOOOOOAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
gonna check to see if any of my favorite egirls like this later  just to see, you know  just out of curiosity 
I am hungry and I am horny.
imagine this weekly is just slightly green and then the next 9 are red again after the reset
solid feed 
I'm indifferent to most politics  I know it affects me  but I don't affect it very much, or at least there are things I can do to affect my own life and my community more directly and effectively  I say I'm Republican though because then the leftist chicks try to save me
It's times of high inflation like these where it is more important than ever to steal from Walmart
I'm jealous about every single eligible woman that is with any man except for me on the whole planet  I can even think of fertile young women out there not with me and it makes me jealous  every single woman should be only with me  aha 
man I see alot of I've barely noticed any inflation at all takes  idc if you're rich or what broh  how could you not notice lmao  out here buying a bottle of sriracha from the gas station for $11
I actually start every conversation with this line in real life  just so people know 
I'll go to the golf clubhouse  I'll see a hot, young drinks girl behind the empty bar  bored, a little secretly sad, exhausted by the old creepy men that oogle her  and I think to myself  what would Drake do
It's cool to have this account to interact with all the people from CT that I like, but that have me muted on my main because they can't stand the self-referencing
I am literally indifferent to the current thing
Idk what Pizza Hut did but I think I'll continue to get Pizza Hut once every two years like I always do  I probably won't even think about it  Imagine diverting from eating Pizza Hut to send a message  get a life lol! 
Who needs they withdrussy suspendeded  omg meeeee 
lmao  Adding ussy suffix to any noun still hasn't not made me laugh yet 
Coinbase has frozen my withdrawals for 24 hours to protect me  I feel so safe thanks Coinbase Daddy
I have definitely noticed it lmao  everything is 2x what it cost last year 
My dick is 8 inches and girthy for all you salivating weebs that want to imagine it right now 
As a 6’2, athletic, well-hung, cool man  social media has still convinced me I am not worthy of reproduction  I should have been 6’4, more athletic, bigger dick and cooler  There is only 1 apex chad in existence that will sire the entire next generation  imagine settling, ladies 
I have a certain policy where if I'm scrolling the timeline and I see a tweet that makes me audibly laugh or even chuckle  like I actually make a sound  I scroll back and hunt it down and give it a like  it's my policy brohs
Hang out in places where people play games or hobbies of strategy  chess club, RTS gaming club or online ranked ladder...  financial markets...  also other sports if they're more of a well-rounded kind  INTJs thrive on competition, esp the kind that makes use of the brane 
For all you myers briggs nerds that are also INTJs  I really think my life is majorly enhancing by cultivating a healthy as possible Tertiary Fi and practicing constant physical stuff like a martial art to ground oneself in one's inferior Se  Brings life much more into balance
I'm kind to people (unless they demonstrate they're hot garbage humans)  Being kind actually works pretty well with the ladies, but only if it's genuine and u'd do the same for anyone  some of my bros are too afraid of getting friendzoned so they neg   it is cringe AF!
My head says I'm not sure what happens next short term in the market, but even if we rally, it's still a bear market until at least early next year  my heart says..eh I don't really pay much attention to that - it's always wrong anyway  my testicles say BUY but that's always true
the worst thing is when someone calls just to say hi  Hi.  pregnant pause  It's like DUDE  DUDE!!!  I'm laying out in the sun over here thinking  mfs dont even have an agenda with the call sometimes 
Broh I'm an INTJ I literally just want to lay in the sun and zone out for 7 hours straight while I plan out the next 10 years of my life in incremental steps I don't want to come hookah and hacky sack AGAIN today 
Problem with being an introvert is everyone is always calling or texting me and wants to hang out when I just want to be alone  I imagine the problem with being an extrovert is no one calls or texts and you always want to hang out
No woman has all 3  No debt, full figure, Che's phone number
I guess there wouldn't be anything particularly novel about it since I'm pretty sure every single male on CT with a cartoon or goofy avatar is actually shredded, handsome and well-hung  I'd just be one among many 
Actually kind of tempted to post fizeek  I went from 215 fatty boom boom  to 180 and reasonably shredded for hot goblin summer  but the tats are doxable ig
It’s fucken embarassing to get a a Tinder notif  It might as well be a “this dude is down BAD” alarm
Im really surprised at how nfts have managed to survive the market nukes so far tbh I thought most lines would die  maybe Ill make my own free mint someday for the culture  got a few funny ideas
Im at a pool rn  sunnin and gunnin  not a care in the world  chick just walked past me with a MASSIVE camel toe
Our friendship goes back to like 2018 discord stuff  Then outta the blue she was like  help her pick out an outfit  I mean yeah I’ll treat her the same as I would have anyway  but it really subverted my expectations 
I just learned this morning that one of the close frens I have on CT that Ive spoken with for years  that I always assumed was a dood  is actually a really sexy woman irl  I dont know how to feel lol
when any of the 1000’s of women I flirt with has any kind of success with any man other than me 
I still remember chilling in altcoin discords in 2018  every 10% rally all the regulars would come in, post a party parrot and then ask “why are we mooning?” or “any news?”  and I would know  deep in my heart  that they had sold before the pump to try to buy more lower
My name is actually Jim Cruelmann  She calls me Mr. Cruelmann  “Oh please Mr. Cruelmann, dont be cruel” 
That’s actually bold I like it  The only problem is that she’s a sweet person  and I am a cruel man  a tall, cruel man  sometimes cruel  always tall 
I have to return some video tapes 
lmao just imagineeee 
Having sex with a woman is…  hmmm…  how to describe  I dont think I could describe it without getting banned  it feels good on ze pp 
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  hooking up with the ex was worth it lads  now to manufacture an excuse to leave
my ex is hotter than all these dating app thots anyway  I might as well  am I playing with her emotions?  perhaps  but that’s a risk I am willing to take 
You know what  It’s time to go hook up with the ex   just the way it is  ijdc
This is my Bumble profile picture and my bio is I HATE DATING  thoughts? 
I just swiped left on Tinder until I ran out of swipes  Tinder has always been a fetid swamp  but nowadays the bilge rats have grown larger and smellier  do I get a Bumble
Online dating profile thots be like “if u cant handle playing second fiddle to my dogggg it’s never gonna workkkk”  well okay then idiot thanks for making it easy
I stg placing an order on kucoin be like  spot at $5  just want to market in  type in $5.01  submit order  WHOOOOOSHHHHH  every ask until 5.011 vanished  you cancel the order  WHOOOOOOSHHHH  they reappear
Y'all ever see Fate: Zero?  Literally just dudes addressing each other with titles like Archer, Lancer and Swordsman  Literally the gayest shit I have ever seen  good though
These mfs when I bring out another full bag of garbage at 1 am 
سأتحدث بالعربية فقط حتى يضخ الشيوخ السوق

imagine the smell 
I think one of the reasons I'm able to always be really calm  is that I set aside alot of cash  I have my expenses covered for many, many years (and those expenses are pretty low since frugality too)  I really think all in culture on this app is pretty bad
I wish I had his conviction  I'm leaning towards capital preservation mode  but I'm Che Guevoblin

I'm hungry boys  Hungry like the wolf  What should I order from Doordash  Cheat day anything mf goes
Anyone less lazy than me want to backtrack through the fear and greed index on bittycon  and see whether there has ever been an extended consolidation where we were unequivocally in extreme fear  where it dumped out of that consolidation?
I would sacrifice the children of a million suns  just to get over my ASMR tingle immunity
I agree more with the first part than the second part  ppl should be allowed to pass wealth to their progeny (how much is healthy vs not is its own debate)  but Ive never seen wealth as a flex  it’s just a thing u chose to pursue by sacrificing other choices 
This price level has got me scared and horny  which is always how I feel anyway
This tweet has got me down tremendous 
it also means that if I ever make my own nft line with a free mint of a meme I make up down the road  I can point back and say look how well that did 
wyd about the goblintown nft line that is over 6 eth floor I bet that STINGS man  I'm over it  ijdc tbh, if anything I kind of feel emboldened, knowing a meme I helped popularize is so lucratively made into an nft  even if it goes to 100 or 0 life is too short to be salty
I know by the way height is a complete meme and I am convinced it is utterly irrelevant  but I will continue to act like it matters  because I am tall 
it's happened already  I feel massively inferior to everyone 6'3 and above  unfit to breathe the same air they breathe  they are our gods and we but mere ants 
Whenever I talk about being 6'2 and everyone shorter than me being a lil manlet it ain't even bragging  it aint even like that  I just spit facts idc
This guy gets it  damn I thought that was gonna get past everyone 
gn brohs 
I feel like $50,000 is fair  especially since it goes where it goes, you cant predict where  the parrot chooses 
What is the least amount of cash you would let a parrot pee on you for
just sent this back no words 
An ex just texted me at 2am asking if I think she is mid and sent a naughty pic lol
One small bump in the road  one littttle hiccup  and these mfs are fucked  fucked fucked fucked  it's hard to have too much sympathy when you make a quarter mil a year  stop being so weak and insecure and start being more frugal goddamn

any double texters are getting this picture as the response now 
The secret to texting women is that you can text them a cute animal in any context and as a response to any question and it's better than anything you could have said  Uhh you didn't respond to my question?? Why didn't you xyz  response: 
SEND NUDE. 
LMAO I do this  but instead of saying welcome back  I always hold up a sign with a phoney name  Hugh Jass  Klein KleinenKleiner  Stephanie Titsnass  Black Betty  Yorgun Axesplitter  Morpheus 
I'm going to leave every. single. response.  on read 
Just blasted every single female in my phone with this  Now we wait 
Going paleo is the only thing that cures my acid reflux  but it cures it within days and it stays away until I start eating carbs and dairy again  just the facts of the case brochachos
Remember how half CT had a hissy fit when fooo sold an honorary jpeg  but when anons made a goblintown dot wtf nft line and are making millions off of the GT meme fooo gets zilch from no one cares  Fascinating culture we got here

Alright brohs  Two weeks of Hiatus across all alts  Not even gonna check apart from maybe the occasionally DM  if I cannot make two weeks  I will resign myself to being here forever just like the burns meme  Ready go.
BTC at 30k: Fear and Greed at 8  BTC at 29k: Fear and Greed at 10  BTC at 28k: Fear and Greed at 13  hmm 
We've progressed from the uh oh up or down phase to the  please for the love of all that is holy can we catch a bounce here phase  and I'm here for it  I really want the market to catch a bounce!

Mental loop about the Waifu quest  1. Must find a waifu  2. Set up dates  3. All dates suck - hope wanes. It's impossible. I am too weird for this. None will be compatible.  4. Stop whining, Che. I WILL. I MUST. I have never failed at anything I put my mind to.   rinse repeat
As a man that worked in finance I will never date a woman that worked in finance sorry  ick
I hate to say it but imagine having lost all your money on Luna and then you borrowed money and all in'd the new Luna at 20 dollars and are already down 75%
So what do you do as a job Che?  I work about 60 hours a week  doing what?  Logging in to Kucoin once
OK off to find a waifu  Waifu-Hiatus  gl out here brohs, dw bear markets don't last forever  they might last a long time tho idk lol  I'll just cheerlead price action by refreshing my coingecko app
Sometimes I doomscroll through Rottentomatoes just to see the horrible takes by critics  but even if I loved a movie and someone writes rotten   and their entire reasoning is Eh.  I have to respect it
Feeling based might have a whiskey and watch Remember the Titans
I've never been a materialist  but I'm considering a few collections  I'd never collect expensive nfts, clothes or whatever  but might amass a library, with comfy chairs and a wheely stairs thingy to reach shelves  and a gun collection  I can see the appeal of some collections
you know I realized I stopped looking for any alpha on this site like 3 years ago, even before a spun up a lil bankroll  If I'm on someone else's page I'm looking for funny shitpoasting
mf @0xalena is one of the funniest accounts on here  I love to check @Pollo2x , her and @DegenSpartan even when I'm 99% on hiatus
Early polls look like about 80% know who my alt is and 20% don't  impressive  Let's check in again in a year and see how those numbers line up heheh 
Let's have some fun  Do you know who my alt account is?
many such cases  many of you don't even know now 
bruh I wouldn't be wondering shit  if I found even a decent one that's good enough for me lmao 
There is only two things preventing me from considering a man  &gt; I literally have no attraction to men whatsoever  &gt; I want to have kids  If I was even remotely bisexual I would have explored dating both as I have zero mental qualms with the notion 
I think I'm going to stop associating with my alts so obviously  like from now on I'm going to build Che Guevoblin up on his own steam  and in 3 years  who will remember?
Hmmmm yeahhh  You know all my talk about trying to get a harem  I could just LARP as a Mormon and take tons of wives  Sorry if you're Mormon but there's a non-trivial chance the whole sect was invented so a dude could live out his dream of having a harem unbothered  based AF 
I literally have everything in my life aligned and sorted  I just need to find one single woman on the whole planet that doesn't talk only about her cat 
My current gameplan is to spend the entirety of this year with the finding of a waifu as my sole mission  Ill start by invading Mennonite church bingo nights and barging in and asking  “any of you wholesome, fertile young mennonites looking to BREED??”  what u guys think 
I know lol  Im 31 already  If I dont find a suitable breeding specimen in like 6-7 years  it’s over  Ill just be a grizzly old wolf writing sci fi novels and rocking in my rocking chair and mowing my lawn every morning to wake up zoomers 
I just need to find a big booty waifu that will say nothing when I yell at the television  or the birds  or my cpu screen  and isnt mf clingy
Im kind of kidding btw Idont say such tings out loud  Im actually a chill, normal guy irl  this account is like the pastebin for my tism 
mf cutie tryna dance nachata with me and Im like  UR NOT DOING IT RIGHT!!!  UR LIMITING MY POTENTIAL  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 
Ppl say ah join yoga or salsa lessons or whatever  but I get so hyper competitive I just focus on doing the yoga or the salsa the best I can until I master it  and then Im like welp now I have mastered another hobby great 
My day today:  Early morning deadlifts  Shower  Gamed for 5 hours  Ate at home  Went to the shooting range with my male frens  Came home  Ate alone  Read  How am I not finding a waifu with this lifestyle   Im at my wit’s end
Yes yes  everyone is poor now  I get it v sad, but itll be fine over time just play future cycles and steal from walmart  meanwhile Im having REAL problems out here  cant find a mf waifu
Ok brohs  I made it 2 days on this dopamine detox  can I make it 2 weeks??
I can't wait to be a dad someday  so I can talk to my kids in their weird zoomer lingo  eat ur vegetables little timmy or u ain't get dessert on g haha fr fr no 🧢
Bear Markets are for traveling and having fun pursuing your hobbies after selling the top  you...  you did sell high right anon?  You...  you listened fooo...  right?
If Mavs reverse sweep…..  Barkley gon be insufferable
mf Bullock cant even hit the rim
Might actually just travel this whole year tbh  Ive definitely spent my 40k hrs in front of a screen  might actually check out this “meatverse”
btw as I am actually hitting my Hiatus stride now, if I'm not responding to your DMs in a conversation, it's because I'm out sunning my ballsack
If Charles Barkley gives up on the Mavs before the game tonight it will be the first reverse sweep in the wcf in history
this book?  An inspiration.  A veritable symphony of prose. I was hooked, link and sinker, but from page 1 until the epilogue.  I literally have never enjoyed anything more than reading this book!   It's like an unending orgasm to read this book  3/5 stars   - goodreads review 
Goodreads review writers be like  Literally flawless. 3/5 stars 
I don't think there any mfs more vicious and merciless than goodreads review writers  it's like 3/5 is excellent with these mfs god DAYUM
Wiggins been playing like a monster in this series btw  Never seen Wiggins play so good  Golden State Wigginses
it’s that hair 
Reggie Bullock 2/14 3 ptrs last night  0/10 tnite  HMMMMM MAYBE STOP LETTING HIM SHOOT THEM
Feelin cute might actually go on Hiatus and dopamine detox from this website that harvests at least 6 hrs of my attention per day aha tho
tweets like this always irk me  nothing against Alex here, Idk him  in general the whole look bitcoin was much less a certain time period ago thing is a non-argument  bitcoin doesn't have to go up forever just because it has  I'm bullish for at least another decade but still 
This autistic toad gently reminding me I still deserve time to rest and recover is gonna save me 
Alright brohs  I'ma sip this whiskey and stare out at the ocean  and listen to this in my earbuds  and think..........................  about the maverinos  
guitar, piano, jazz trombone and bass  and sing  I used to be one of these Circa Survive Anthony Green-esque mfs in college with my band  if you met me you'd be surprised I was going into business bc I didn't wear all the pastel shirts and khaki pants and boat shoes 
I'm gonna have to learn the lyrics to this new Lizzo song with the flute  because it's literally just 40 seconds of the flute and beat and then her saying It's about damn time in my head but it's still stuck in my head
Im literally at a Seedy tavern on friday night on the beach drinking away my bball team’s loss rn and yet somehow Im telling you guys to get a life? 
yall keep hassling me for shkreli takes heres one  I dislike him but mainly dgaf about him  I also think it’s just as weird that half of CT is worshipping him while the other half hates his guts  feels like slow news week that yall care  luna gone from CT entirely already kek
I actuallg love Chuck and he is hilarious  and a good commentator  but our only chance to win is if he gives up hope lol 
It’s not even that charles barkley’s reasoning is flawed in his predictions  it’s just the laws of physics that he cant be right
BOOM BOOM BOOM  I WANT YOU IN MY ROOM  (if u see dis lmk bb)
Im also on the beach  but I am not Cobie  issa coincidence 
Im drinking on the beachc near santa monica pier  the ocean looks purty  Whatever brohs Im over the mavs loss  idc they blew a 20 pt lead  ijdc
Reeeeeeeee 
finna slap that mouth guard out his face idc 
booze was supposed to make me forget about these maverinos  but it’s all I see
you change a human so fear isnt the primary motivation 
Ima need a drink
Pur only chance now is of Chuck switches bias
My evening is ruined
This is all Chucks fault I am never forgiving him 
U DONT WAIT UNTIL 6 SECOND SHOT CLOCK THEN FOUL OMG
Draymond was not about to leave this game without fouling out
Work the stepback 3 you beautiful babyface
Worst officiating I have ever seen
minor defensive adjustment to cover a hot handed Bullock on the close out and now we blew a 20 pt lead  I hate bball 
A disaster is unfolding before my eyes
I think we went 2/19 from behind the arc in the 3rd qtr
If the mavs blow this lead I blame Charles Barkley’s vocal confidence in the mavs
When Bullock and Brunson can make 3’s yall in trouble idc
Bullock got the haerodynamics
Feed Ferrari Doe Doe the rock
Better than the 3 presentations Ive seen here  Im not kidding 
I'm literally about to drop a massive, stanky DEUCE
because of beaches sir 
has any one of you mfs done this by investing in projects outside of the crypto market  how many projects did you have to wait through their presentation before you found a goodie 
Do you startup mfs think potential angels are stupid or something godddddd 
Heading back to LA after yet another disappointing meeting with a startup that was basically full of shit
This is so bullish I'm actually getting a little hard rn  half mast 
Our whole conversation so far:  Her: 🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠  Me: 👺👊🍆💦😱  Her: 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄  Me: 😎😎😎😎😎  I think it's going well so far 
Just texted back this  😎😎😎😎😎 
She just responded   🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 
Honestly my irl shooting percentage with random wyds is higher than I act like in terms of responses  but not amazing at conversion  but it doesn't have to be  if you get a hundred free throws a night and you only need to make one... 
On Cyberbullying  on 1 hand I have never felt cyberbullied and any attempts to do so have resulted in my laughing or clapping back because I genuinely dc  but on the other I avoid piling too much heat on one person, since I respect life and dont want to be part of the reason
I right click save jpegs of hot egirls on the timeline and now I own them (the egirls)
Maybe I'm just a boomer  maybe I had a tougher early life than people or something  but ghosting is right up there with so and so is cyberbullying me   it's like mf just get over it god damn 
Getting ghosted seems to really bother people idk why tho  I've been ghosted and the ghoster  When ghosted I say ok, for some reason this person doesn't want to interact. I can respect that  then later in 3-6 or smth months I'll ping if I still want to  It's nbd! truly
I guess it really depends on a ton of factors how people will perceive ghosting and whether it is good or bad  some say it's bad because it hurts more  some say it's good because it hurts less  I'm in neither camp on that one  I just think it applies to some sitches not others 
ghosting is communication in its own way  it says - this has run its course for now at least  why do people feel entitled to someone else's time  or entitled to someone like... appearing in the flesh so they can make sure they spell out why the other person sucks lol 
I've never understood why people think ghosting is about cowardice  I've done both  breaking up to the face is definitive/final, so if you're SURE it's over, that's fine  ghosting is also fine though - if anything the person that is ghosted and can't handle that is the pussy imo 
wait is there some kind of friday q&amp;a tradition or something  why does everyone keep asking me if I'm going to do a q&amp;a
godddddddd 
I'm a monster I'm beyond redemption  I will literally ignore 10 texts or dms but if someone ignores one of my mine I hold on to it forever 
My biggest pet peeve is when hot women ignore my dms
Said it before and I'll say it again  Good traders should just mute bad takes second offense  There aren't that many good traders on here  there's a bunch of paid group leaders, instructors, trend followers and other sheep  good traders should literally just jizz out opinions 
ah yes the jockeying for excuse pregame competition  whichever team is more maimed pregame has less pressure to succeed and hence better odds  you never see skip talk about that though because for all his bluster and cruetly, he is a retart 
If I start a podcast then all the egirls will learn I have a deeply masculine baritone voice and they will cream too hard  I have to have mercy on them
I feel like I've reached the stage in evolution of market participant where I don't have anything else to do and I loudly consider starting a podcast  either that or I start a fund in real life and then a podcast and just dickride that guy's fund when it's really me
We will bounce from this horizontal  maybe not right this picosecond  maybe a few stabs lower for liquidity  but I'm pretty sure we will...  spot buys at this level will prosper 
What do you see in her she's so ditsy she's just a BIMBO  I see an hourglass figure ok  I see a cute face, little waist with a BIG BACK  I see a goofy ass silly person with a cute aspect  I'm a caveman okay 
My platonic female friends always hate the women I date
I want to date a British chick  I've never dated a British chick  Sexy accent  I need to find a young, peppy Kate Beckinsale
You want to know a cool trick to sift the chaff from the wheat traders and finance guys on CT  If they use as much jargon (of any kind) as possible? They probably suck at finance  If they intentionally break terms down to simplicity? They're probably good at finance 
I personally find finance jargon to be borderline unethical level of psyops to trick normies into thinking the jargon-wielder is hyper knowledgeable   when most finance goons dont know wtf is going on almost ever  but there's a sweet spot where you can google the occasional term 
When I say things like contango and backwardation do u guys know what I'm saying  I've tried to minimize financial jargon on my accounts but I assume you guys either are finance goons like me or you can google  but still - do you know what these terms mean? comment below 
If you're trading spot and there's no threat of liquidation  buying when futures are in backwardation is Ancient Bulla Wisdom 
They should allow me to sun my nuts on this beach  but I guess that would be illegal 
who want me 
I didnt have coffee yesterday  heartburn gone  time to get a coffee  then more beach lounging
We lost another one  damn you Forbes 
As a 6’2 man  I always know there men taller than me than can steal my girl with a look  Ive made peace with this fact  If I truly love her, I let her go 
I can tell you but you wont like it Alex 
Im 6’2  Shkreli is an ant compared to me 
Thank you I shall  and you also as well 
he’s an ugly, snarky chode that tried to make a fortune off hurting sick people  he’s not even tall  it just goes to show how much being a criminal gets girls MOIST  Might have to rob a 7 Eleven every few yrs to keep my future waifu hooked 
Why is every egirl obsessed with Martin Shkreli
Even if you want to spread a culture or belief  or actually influence ppl  calmly laid out arguments on the main in an impersonal manner &gt;&gt;&gt; getting into scraps and owning ppl in the long run  the aesthetic matters 
I honestly think that focusing on putting out only good vibes on this website is the highest evolution of an account  since the low hanging fruit is always ripe for attacking  obviously Ill defend rep but beyond that  Im in my lane  moisturized  flourishing 
Something I have been doing lately is if I see a really stupid post  I type out my vicious reply then I delete it  and I go do a set of pull ups  and Im already getting hella jacked
Im only up 4% on my current entries  So scared right now
just responded  👺👊🍆💦😱  now we wait  🤝 
good poast  im ngl I never read those outlook emails they can smd  but it’s not bc they suck which they do  it’s because I never read any emails at all  there’s never a reason to check ur email 
me n WHO 
when she dms one of ur alts asking whether you know another one of ur alts bc she thinks he’s hot  😌🤌
Im going to protect pollo and mewny from all you mfs
Anyways gn brohs  tmrw hiatus
I go to the trouble of liking most comments even here  in order to give you that sweet dopamine you need
babies crying 
it's funny you'll get people like YOU IGNORE THE NEWS BECAUSE YOU CAN *AFFORD* TO!!! WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR LIFE??  I mean that's all relative right, but if some bullshit happens in my real life I'll just deal with it and get back to vibing... 
y'all want to know how I'm a happy person that is almost always in a good mood?  It's because I ignore the news and I ignore bad vibe people  I ignore bad music  I ignore and disregard shitty movies and tv shows  I disrespect seed oils and gluten  I'm a grandmaster ignorer
lmfao every 20 days or smth for 3 minutes I check the news and it's just Forbes begging me to eat bugs and lentils 
I'm too good for it  I'm above it  I think I'm better than it 
I havent saluted and I'm not going to idc
Wholesome Raccoon meme 
This is difficult to remember at times, but I don't think I have ever seen any situation where it hasn't proven true 
Every day I'm reminded that Twitter social dynamics are very different than irl  it's an attention platform  example: when u argue ad infinitum with someone, ur giving them more attention  ignoring/muting/blocking is the power-move on Twitter  It's mute/block uber alles.
Personally I dont really care for the miladys  but many of my friends are financially tied up in them   some have overinvested  it is what it is  so I just let em be 
only time Im truly rid of reflux is when Im paleo fr 
today it is milady drama  luna forgotten by most  in 5-7 biz days itll be smth new  the world turns
surprised to learn this was not a copypasta but in fact stockmart straight up goin off 
Man I am so fucken tired of every single youtube suggestion being about the damn Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial  Bring me back the 2015 Italian Women's Pole Vaulting Qualifiers I'll watch that shit
apart from hiatus though I might comment 'SHOW HOLE' in replies from time to time  only if tempted 
Ever since I started muting or blocking anyone I felt tempted to cyberbully I feel like my soul is cleaner which is a refreshing feeling  also I haven't seen a single Luna tweet while scrolling today fyi (Mohammad's Law prevails again)  anyways back to Hiatus
I’m seeing this gif and Im pretty sure it’s time for me to finally fully go on Hiatus 
where tf is dat bulmerino  dat bulmeruni 
My whole life is a cyclical balancing act of hunger and heartburn
My self? Shmoasted up.  My turkey and cheese sammich? preferably toasted up.
BULMA!!!!! bring me a cheese and turkey sammich! Im too Shmoasted up to even move rn

It’s midnight and Im shmoasted up on this hotel bed watching espn like every night
“wow Che seemed like such a nice and attentive guy then I let him hit once and Im ghosted” 
Most bball takes on twitter actually suck  Mine are good though

BBB is Chaotic Evil btw if you hadn't figured that out
I want to smoke a J with Reggie Bullock and watch old SNL tbh
How many alts I got on ct
Bullock swaggin out here like Ima go 2/14 3 pointers tonight idc 
ok well this didn't work 
I hate that mouth guard chewing 
My IQ is like 135  which is the perfect IQ  any more than that and it opens up terrifying vistas of reality sufficient to drive one back into the comfort of a new dark age  any less and you miss things 
I have more apple cider vinegar than stomach acid rn
I just might 
Nah certain stuff is off limits  Even my evil accounts won't accept paid shills or cyberbully the same person over and over  it'll be more how their general outlook affects their shitposting 
wyd 
I have a Lawful good account  This is my Chaotic Neutral account  might build one account per alignment
I mute for a lame take  I mute for a whim dude  idc
Modernity is fuckin weird dude  How our genes evolved: I got a random chick pregnant? woohoo!  The modern male: I got some random chick pregnant? AW FUCK ME 
Just got a text from a female and it's this  🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠  wtf does that mean
y'all remember the WOMP  The Way of Most Pain  lmfao  It was literally a copypasta almost  the WOMP is _______________  insert whatever would benefit the poster
CMONNNNNNNN 
Tall jerk seeking supple, impressionable female ages 23-27. Have money but won't spend. Short-tempered and critical. Choleric temperament. Nothing serious. Will make fun of people in front of you. Hmu. 
few understand  it's why all the good traders just shitpost  we don't care what anyone thinks about the market we're here to jizz out our own opinions not read others' 
I think the only thing in the whole world I actually fear is Munje 
u kno how the bottle is like  put a little teaspoon in with 8 oz of water  or wahtever  I just chug this shit out the bottle  I'll probably down 1/4 a bottle of Bragg acv tonight dude 
chuggin on this bottle of apple cider vinegar like it juicy juice rn
maybe I'll drive up to SF tomorrow and see about a couple other opportunities I was recommended exploring while I'm in the state  I mainly came out here to vacation tbh I could have skyped these buckos 
I am angry and I am horny  I'll probably head out on the prowl and see what actress/barista I can seduce  all the possible investment opportunities ended up sucking so I'm done early and I'm still here till Saturday 
We cannot win until this man flips his bias  it's just physics 
how is ESPN dunking on my boy rn 
My mavs got slaughtered and I blame Charles Barkley for sayin Mavs in 7
This is my general life policy  only invest in the absolute best of anything and just leave the rest  best action is often inaction  at least I'm getting to chill on the beach all day 
I'm pretty sure I'm going to leave LA having invested in nothing
It looks like Big Balls Bulla is back on the timeline  that guy is a menace
Problem with taking a Hiatus is I have so many alts that if they all take a hiatus at the same time yall will figure me out
tryna lose to these guys at golf rn to make them feel special but I cant abide repeated 3 putting  Im gonna have to beat them  now it looks like we all suck
I am going to strive to make sure that each CT person that invents a cool idea or notion gets their deserved clout  Mohammad's Law - @Abu9ala7   Mewny's Razor - @mewn21   are the 2 so far and I will update the list 
Now the timeline is all S&amp;P is fcked, Jay Pow gonna beatings continue until morale dissipates.  There's a bit of Luna Poasting but really not the fuck that much, esp considering proposal came out today about Luna Classic n shit  Mohammad's Law uber alles 
Like we're all going to have a downfall someday over something, right? 
I think that the cause for one's downfall having been sending a dick pic is actually a really based downfall
Sending a dick pic has been the downfall of many powerful men  and yet
I'm not interested in people rating it unless it's 10/10 which it would be 
The Masculine urge to send a dick pic
You know how I used to promise a dick reveal in exchange for the next level of followers  I never have sent a dick pic in my life  but after talking about it so much  I kind of want to someday  amazing how malleable brain plasticity is
Anyways I'm busy all day today  but just remember for when the times get truly hard  it takes a big man to cry  and it takes a bigger man  to laugh at that man 
After having spent 35,000 hours staring at charts and brooding about macro I have gained the ability to simply dip into the source-stream of markets and divine the future from their silvery currents 
newcummers know for fooomst they must simp 
At least half a dozen ct egirls got their start by simping for me on the timeline  and I look forward to dozens more  Call it the egirl encubator
Dont we all broh  dont we all  sigh 
Oh wow yet another cute animal pfp OG from CT doxxes as a handsome stud  what a surprise 
“Moisturized,” quoth Doncic, in between bites of his McChicken, extra mayo, “unbothered. In my lane” 
This is overall entries already  Im not planning to buy any more  I wanted to have bought in May and sell later, like frogust or smth  Im not nearly all in either and I dont plan to be  Hardest thing will be not avging down if we nuke but it be what it be 
My average buys are 27.9k bittycone and 1850 eth  so you guys can know how down tremendous I am later
damn didnt know Bezos liked teasing compliments on his booty so much 
Lmfao  tell me before u do dis broh 
idk how I found this gif or why but yeah 
Espn truly is the last, best refuge of the male mind  an enclave of tournament pagentry and smack talk  endless, trivial speculation  tactics and strategy  espn is my shield and my cuirass against the malaise of modernity brohs
I feel like cavemen would have posted up on a hotel bed and scrolled espn if they could have
Should I go and do something this evening or just stay posted up on this hotel bed scrolling thru espn
I think I talk about finance too much and I dont shitpost enough
Skip doesnt even follow anyone  not even Shannon  what a fucking dickhole!
The only mf consistenly wronger than Skip is Charles Barkley but I actually like Barkley whereas I just find Skip to be a massive idiot lol 
I never block him tho because I like the way he makes me angry somehow  he’s the ppl you love to hate innit 
I tweeted about basketball twice and now my feed is all retarted skip bayless tweets god I wish he would shut up
Imagine not prepping for the zombie apocalypse  and the zombie apocalypse happens  and youre like ah dang Ive only seen a dozen movies about this  I bet ud feel p stupid 
smol portions/meals and apple cider vinegar are the permanent solutions  but I didnt bring any acv  issa ok brohs  heartburn aint shiyeet 
massive smothered burrito lol  it was worth it  I just need one powerful, wall-shaking gigaburp and Ill be good 
tryna BURP off dis heartburn dawgs
I am the god emperor of heartburn
love me or hate me I will never delete a mf tweet idc
This kombucha aint agreeing w me 
investees*  too late to delete and re-tweet  I observe the 1 minite rule 
to be fair this one is the first time Ive been obvious about it 
If Im not hanging with these investors  and I cant line up a hot date with an egirl   Ill hang with you guys 
People already dont know who else I am on CT
How my generation flirts:  teasing, humor, direct and indirect compliments, insinuation, euphemism, innuendo  how gen z flirts:  DOES U HAB DAT GRIPPY N DAT SLOPPY?
mfs on twitter be like   “Oh you bought x?? think of how many children you could have fed with that money!”   and they never dono’d to a charity in they whole life
thanks for all the nice dms dudes  I read them, I just pretend I dont check dms often bc I often just skim since theres tons  esp on fooo’s act (I probably dont see all those tbh)  and dont worry the hiatussy will never be THAT long  twitter is like crack
“that unhealthily obese goddess on the cover of sports illustrated is a goddess and men are just jealous they cant have her”  - women less obese on the internet, projecting their own self-obsessesion and unconcerned about the poor example being set  man it is like clockwork dude
Beautiful weather here in Santa Monica  yall spoiled  in the midwest it’s been a whorling malestrom of freezing rain until last week lmao
I also tend to think if youre flexing “status” youre basically saying “look how lvl I am in someone else’s game!”  which is a self-own 
u might say “broh if you think money isnt a personality why are u tryna make so much”  because money is awesome lol. it’s like mana. the more you have the more you can do what you want in the world etc  but I dont think wanting lots of mana makes me better than anyone 
as a sigma male I can tell you this sounds about right  It’s been nice to see CT begin to realize wealth isnt a personality 
doing this while working a job until you dont need to is the best RR by far  CT is bursting with chodey exemplars of massive survivorship bias while we dont see the 99.99% of their carbon copies that busted over and over forever 
anyone who disagrees with this is probably selling you something  like their paid courses or group  or got rich with ref links or something 
biggest takeaway from 35,000 hours of staring at charts and contemplating a trade is to trade wayyyyyyyyyy less often  I take 1 or 2 a year only the easiest  some years I just hold 
some of yall be like  “man I wish I could just laze on the beach and take meetings about investments”  ok broh but do you want to stare autistically at charts for 35,000 hrs first to earn it doe
after a lil sleuthing it seems like dfk arena is seperate from the dfk team that applied for a grant but didnt get it but made it anyway  interesting 
How is dfk arena

What she says: UGH assigning numbers to women’s attractiveness is so chauvanistic!  what she means: Im not confident Id rank highly  what she wonders: how do men come up with the number  it’s a sort of intuitive gutfeel like picking the iron in golf 
Damn in Santa Monica every barista is at least a strong 7
Y’all want to know what being 31 is like?  You rich enough not to sweat the $ you pay for a coffee  but you pay a different price  ay Ill take a small coffee  “Alright sir, that will be one acid reflux please”
it’s all in the hips 
Broh it is a sad fucken age where every single comedian tweets and then immediately apologizes  I will never apologize for a joke  Send the raging hordes of angry npcs  I will just destroy them and gain xp
I have that new Lizzo song stuck in my head except I dont remember any of the lyrics  so it’s literally the beat and that fucking flute and every two minutes Lizzo saying “It’s about damn time”
turned out to be a good decision 
It’s too early to go to bed  Im heading out for a drink at one of these seedy beachside taverns
lmaoooo  I really look like Doncic  imagine if he decides to visit a gym someday instead of just hookahing and wolfing down mcchickens  he’d be a demigod 
All you Maren haters claiming she is too vague  yall just adding to her mysterious allure you know
I block fast and furious   but I mute even more often  I curate my feed until it is the best feed  the perfect feed  I abhor ugliness   and love beauty
gn brohs  tmrw hiatus
I am hungry and I am horny. 
time to hit up the santa monica whole foods and stock up on the most california-y whole-foodsy stuff I can find to stock my hotel fridge  I'm talkin  booch. wheatgrass shots. gluten free something or others. acai whatevers. idk whatever sounds super california-y for the culture
It's seems like you're fucking around...  Would you like to find out? 
Do start ups listen to angel investors or are they like well thanks for the money bucko! and then do their own thing
I'm here til Saturday so I can either hang out with these guys a bunch  or visit family and otherwise just chill in LA  and they intrigued me but I also saw at least 2 immediate problems  fun tho 
I love Investment Hulk  easily one of the more slept on CT personalities 
My questions were  do u love me  are you playin ur love gamessss with me  then I invited them to my downstairs mixup 
Had my first meeting with potential investeees  potentially promising  now I need to head back to my hotel and mull over whether to meet more  I've never invested in a company like this I'm literally winging it
If you are about to go into a meeting with a potential angel investor  don't fuck it up  because it might literally be fooo and you don't know 
Time to meet deez mfs and see if they are worthy of receiving my seed  funding
I’m living dangerously out here  whenever I walk past police I wear a Mona Lisa smile 
I will never pay them. 
LA Vice 
Bruh Im driving a rented car rn but I just know these santa monica mfs gonna figure out Im here I have like 40 unpaid parking tickets from years ago

You actually are rn  imagine every dude you pass is me because it's possible 
wyd LA
He's talking about my Hiatuses 
Eat shit Bayless! 
Havent you ever heard of hiatus-poasting 
this shit will never not blow my mind  how so many mfs out there without an internal monologue is unfathomable to me  and you think NPCs dont exist goddamn dude  this is why we have cycles in everything  humans, en masse, not only never lern, they cannot  anyways back to hiatus 
Twitter issa dopamine succubus and it isn't going to harvest me anymore!!  Hiatus time fr
Some days Im like  who does fooo think he is only following 69  what a monster  but then I realize  All I need is that one fleeting fooo like  and the sun is shining again
I feel like everything anyone ever says or does is just a subtle attempt to get fooo’s attention and fleeting approval 
LA girls lemme see ya hands wave em at them bishes hatin on u with they frens  girl u got let em know that everything big  nails done hair done NELS DUN HUR DUN
I’m actually a little depressed and hurt that @bitcoinpanda69 doesnt even follow me
Back soon brohs  and who are we kidding  at least in the replies here and there before that lol 
It's fitting I might end up doing my first angel investing in the city that is so named this month  anyways back to Hiatus brohs  it's been nice being around twitter less  refreshing to take a lil breakerino 
What's the best Sushi place in LA brohs
I know this is old news by the way I'm just trolling  the way I do  anyways back to that hiatussy in that LAussy 
y'all REALLY tryna kill my boner today innit 
OPE  time to dump all them stables for BITTYCONE 
feeling swaggy might board a plane to LA wyd 
Uncut Luna Inu degens slithering out of their caves and bettin’ on this shit 
By the way if it isnt massively clear Im not buying into Justin Trons shit with usdd and tron and never will be  at all.  Its time for this market to stop with the algo stables
As much as it will be insanely difficult, I am also going to take a Hiatus  I dont want to let Summer pass by without touching serious grass  plus crypto looks tasty to start investing again  gl out there dawgs  might check dms occasionally
My BO smells good idc
The moment I fall asleep is the moment the market flash wicks to zero innit
U might be wondering why it’s easy for me to be kind to the lunatics despite them flexing all year  whereas now the threads are all about healing after they lost all their and their childrens money  its bc Ive seen the rise and fall of many ponzis  nubs lern. the world turns.
Looks like it's going to zero now  like I said I think this is better that way  billions in market cap erased in an instant rather than a slow decay slog
Got some eggs and gruyere in the fridge  but I'm POSTED up in bed rn  but I'm hungry af doe  I'm going to have to make a decision dawgs
There is peace in that knowlege  No matter what happens in this world  CT will forget about it insanely fast 
The craziest part about this all  is that the entire timeline will forget about it in 5-7 days
Last tweet about it  Ultimately Do Kwon got what was coming to him now  His project has been fucked, his reputation fucked, he is humiliated and down tremendous in many ways besides money  So I think justice is served already  no need to dogpile now, it's just ugly 
Like I said he said some pretty dang arrogant stuff and deserves to get some shit for it  but I see everyone on twitter ready to purge themselves of sin completely by burning the witch  and it looks ugly to me 
Indeed  If Do Kwon had been malicious and like  shorted into liquidity pockets with reserves or some zany shit  then yeah have at it  but he was just a guy trying to build something cool and make people rich who got caught up, let it get to his head, and it didn't work out 
To be clear I think joking or meme'ing or making fun of him in some ways is fine  he deserves to be criticized and made fun of  but not deeply insulted, cajoled, ridiculed, shamed, threatened, bringing his daughter into it and so on  there's a line 
As someone that literally makes every major life decision from thoughts &gt; feelings in my life  I can say we can afford to spare some empathy right now...  people say oh he'll still be rich   sure.  but also ostracized. humiliated. his reputation tarnished beyond retail too 
Yeah look the guy was far from perfect  I learned even a bit more arrogant than I had thought before  he said some dumb stuff  but he probably got caught up in the moment too right  I'm not saying he should be let off scot free  but he's already suffered tremendously for all this 
What are you guys trying to do to the guy  At this point Do Kwon is already living out his worst nightmare  Can you imagine being in his place right now?  He tried to build a stable coin. Didn't work out so good. But it's not like he planned to fail now is it.  Have some decorum 
I'm keeping it extra wholesome and kind on the fooo main  but even here I dont plan to twist the knife on anyone  I scroll through the timeline and see people I respect just saying the nastiest, most unnecessary shit  chill out guys seriously - get likes some other way 
and yet I've found it pretty easy not to make fun of anyone about the LUNA thing  in fact I'm pretty fucking surprised at some of you all   twisting in the knife right now on people  on Do Kwon and others  they've suffered enough 
This whole situation sucks  It's kind of why I would prefer UST to go to zero now rather than some drawn out slog  a mercy stroke, if you will  retail will be demolished all at once and can focus on rebuilding their lives 
ngl there is probably something to this  but I dont want to be the one to try and catch the knife  if I was going to try, I'd wait until the peg was restored and price was low af but the wider market caught a bid 
I feel like I'm going to call every single woman I date quirky and there's nothing anyone can do to stop me
this mf hops out the Tesla and swogs up into the sushi den and slaps the waitress's ass wyd 
I've been making mindful efforts that keep myself back from just making fun of everyone all the time it's crazy  and making enough money to not have to work definitely has not helped that lol 
I feel like I get meaner every year
I'm feeling kind of aggro  think I might not respect Mia Khalifa's rebrand
I think it was near Santa Monica  there was some place and you could get infinite sushi for like 20 bucks  probably 30 now bc inflation and whatever  anyone know what I'm talking about 
I'm gonna be in LA twice in the next two months  Do they still have that all you can eat sushi place
full disclosure I cannot find the email account or password to him 
I pretty much only have enough time to satisfy one of these problems tonight which should it be 
I am hungry and I am horny 
Honestly the entire fate of the Mavericks just depends on whether we get tranquil happy Doncic or tilted emotional Doncic
If I can't you can't  sorry 
The Mavs are a streaky team too  We need to lead at all times or Doncic gets tilted and the team loses heart and suddenly we're down 30
Finney-Smith is the key idc  when it's the Doncic or Brunson drive into the lane every time down  the Mavs get fcked  when they open up the offense and feed good outside shooters until they get a hot hand  Mavs win by 20  As a guy sitting on the couch it feels obvious to me

This tbh.  I dont have a girlfriend, but I do have a harem of sorts irl  and I maintain it, in large part, because I dump all my mental illness and autism here  on to you, dear reader  yes you  thank you for receiving my autism 
Getting real tired of Zoomers and their bs  It's not entirely their own fault in the sense that we live in the Attention Economy, which rewards doing the most  bombastic shit to out-insane other people for attention and clout  Attacks on comedians shows a frail society indeed 
I think over the next few days Ill mainly be bot poasting in the mentions of big accounts
I literally also got instant dms about the note app lmao  I'll take a look 
Imagine not documenting every single one of your lifts and runs in excel
yeah that’s true  here I am saying “oh Im gonna spend less time on here” and not doing it  that’s actually 100% on me  so it’s time to change that and be here less for real  not gone  but less  might try private mode like Messi suggests, we’ll see 
This is definitely my go to strat  if I know I can get 40% of the pie  Ill angle for 33%  the other people involved will know and theyll know you didnt put the extra squeeze on em when you could have 
You know what  maybe Im just going to start tweeting less  once or maybe for a few hours every couple days  like someone that isnt addicted  I blame the shit midwest weather for not already having made this adjustment actually 
Just watched the second and third episode of Ozarks  and I have to say  eh
aaaaaaaaaaaa Im tweeetinggggg  fhjdnekmdmdmdmmdmfmm 
tweeting is like cooming  It’s impossible to take a hiatus forever
I mean that’s true  I love spreading joy and wholesomeness  but the main reason I keep returning   is that I have to coom  I have to coom based takes onto the timeline 
This is how my attempts at hiatus go  Im on hiatus  ah this is fine  then I think of a banger tweet  then I write up and save a draft  then back to hiatus  another banger  ah fuck I have to cooom   I have to coom this banger out  then I do  then 6 hrs later Im still here 
“I spend too much time on this fucking site”  me, constantly

Here is the way to use Twitter  Have fun  post things you like  interact with people you like  instablock people who suck  except a punching bag or two you keep around for the lols or as an example  99% shitposting fun  if twitter serves u, u win  if u serve twitter, u lose 
even as someone that’s mostly out  I think we all at least medium key wish this  high key, perhaps 
300 following  300 spartans  coincidence?
Okay okay  turn off da waterworks 
Yeah theyre both alts of the other  its cool tho, Im not going to let some chode be the only representation for miladys  overall Im not really into em though 
alright Im going to give Ozarks a chance again  better be good tho
two accounts that joined in may 2022 to suck each others cocks with made up shit in the replies  dont worry I now know this is the lame minority of milady holders...  majority of you seem alright 
There will be more cycles in my opinion  10 bitcoin is alot of money even right now  I guess it partially depends on what make it is to you  but if you have even 100k at the bottom of the next cycle, buy some gudcoins and stay in spot, you'll be fine I think 
of course they can  if they're patient and they wait for the bottom of the cycle and they stay in spot and dont bust themselves doing dumb shit 
Now that I know that the schtick is to be over the top aggro to defend milady I actually dont mind the pasta being created  because it's like milady white knight defender bait  but like I said it's a dice roll as to whether the specific defender is lame or funny for it to be good 
Give the goblin gift that keeps on giving  100's of scam bots in the replies 
ahh so I guess the whole thing about miladys is to defend your milady with trumped up hostility that's humory/trolly  huh  I dont hate that concept but if it's done by someone who is lame it comes across that way which doesn't help the brand
that's kind of how it is with most shows to be fair  whether good or not, I always (should) try to give a show at least 2 eps to get going 
Lil Ze is a based sigma 
City of God is an excellent film 
yeah that's kind of true  most films and shows kind of suck these days  there was a glory decade from like 2000 to 2010 for shows and films 
nice catch  the cringy neckbeard defending his milady  that's the real milady pasta lol  have you heard of memes says the guy with 3x as many following as followers to the guy with 69 following and 72k followers on his main and 12x his on his alt  cant make this stuff up... 
ah and he preemptively blocked me  not a flex, perhaps  but talk about a pansy  y'all miladys need to work on your public relations 
lmao like look at this take for example  is this how all miladys are? because if so it sounds like the community is dogshit actually 
The blackest pill of all 
Idk man I never said I disliked miladys  but it's like their community wants to turn me against them for no reason except insecurity  weird and kind of unwholesome
Z gave Ozarks or whatever it's called an 8.8/10  that's pretty damn high  but I'm still on the fence  what do you guys think about it
I actually think the fact that a ton of miladys zoomed in to try and defend their milady, while probably in line with the whole theme, shows weakness too  like broh chill lol are you that scared of a gobin that dgaf about you 
the fact that this became a pasta just makes me slightly more bearish on miladys 
Life is indeed mostly about discernment  most things arent good or bad  money, power, violence and so on  life is about having the wisdom to discern when the time is right to do or how to apply each of these things and when not to 
it should be noted that I literally never block people for disagreeing with me  I disagree all the time  I find value in it  same for constructive criticism  but you can always tell when someone is being constructive or well intentioned vs when they're just being a bitch
oh  yeah it's possible they couldn't handle the tweets or something and had to fly into a rage  most trolls literally just want validation and attention from senpai  so they can get it the proper way or not at all 
you'll see things differently if you spin up an account with like 10k followers or more  you'll start getting hit with a ton of notifs, and you'll just start removing all the excrement without a second thought  natural process 
I dont see it that way  as someone who blocks fairly often I see it as ah this guy is a retart, no value here block 
they can make an alt to see it  but then they'll have to stay on good behavior right  so they have to control their shit this time or they'll get the ban hammer too...  idk the whole look I got blocked hue hue thing is weird to me 
I mean  when I block someone, I'm forbidding them from interacting with me or seeing my posts  if there is alpha in my posts, they miss out  they lose interacting privileges  the main thing is a demonstration of I dont need you and you dont get to see my stuff now 
I guess if it's someone like Nassim Taleb who spouts a bunch of anti fragile stuff but then blocks you for disagreeing it could be *understandable* to be blocked  but a flex is a stretch even there  I can't imagine it's hard to get blocked by the guy 
I've said this before on the fooo account  but I can't say it enough  it's not a flex if someone blocked you lol  maybe there's like one or two exceptions but I can't think of one  I can't think of a single situation where it doesn't reflect worse on you than them
it really isn't how many followers you have in this game  especially if u snipe at huge accounts to farm engagement  it's about who respects your skill   and your relationship with your following  Better to be respected by others that are gud and have a loyal following every time 
Heres the thing  some clout-chasing MF can try to shittalk my boy @CryptoKaleo   but *I* know Kaleo is a beast trader and I've never even heard of this guy  you can't just make up random shit on the internet because those who are good at this remember how things go and keep track 
yeah exactly  if I give my word I won't cheat, I wont cheat end of story  doesnt matter how tempting someone is  but I'm still going to flirt because it's fun and wholesome  I get that people might not believe me or whatever  it's something they'd learn over time though 
I dont get the miladys  is it like we're neckbeards that tip our fedoras but we're ironic about it but kind of still the butt of our own joke and ultimately we kind of revel in it  or what  idk like I get the apes  they're apes, it's kind of funny right  apes in suits etc
lmaoooo  alright fine send it I ethink we should edate other epeople
